About once every thirty-six hours, I wonder randomly about opera. Will we ever see a live _Ring Cycle_ again? Will that big _Parsifal_ that the COC is supposed to do in the fall actually happen (that's a selfish one, I admit, because I'm seriously in the mood for an opera marathon)? How long does the average singer have before the lack of gigs ousts them from the industry?

I'm not sure if it's a good use of energy to unpack all these what-if questions. These days, we're all wondering very aggressively about our respective futures, and the infuriating thing is that the answer hasn't really changed from any other time we wondered about days to come - we don't know!

I know, it's the worst.

But there's one very basic question that opera warrants, and I think it's worth a revisit in these exhilarating times. Here it is, perhaps to your chagrin:

Why are they singing?

It's a question that an opera newcomer has every right to ask, and one that an opera veteran might have forgotten the answer to. Years ago, my in-laws asked me a version of that question, after coming with me to see _Peter Grimes_. At the very end of that opera, there are a few spoken lines, and I imagine that's why they asked me on our way out of the theatre, "Why wasn't it all just a play?"
