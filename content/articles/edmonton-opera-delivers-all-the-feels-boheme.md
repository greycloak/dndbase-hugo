What’s an operatic production without a bit of drama?

After a period of relative managerial upheaval and the challenges associated with mounting a mainstage production during a global pandemic, [Edmonton Opera](/scene/companies/edmonton-opera/) delivers a moving production of Puccini's beloved _La Bohème_. The production marks the first mainstage performance for the company since announcing Joel Ivany as its new Artistic Director in November 2021, and the installation of Shannon Hiebert as the new Chorus Master.

COVID also threw a wrench into the production when leading man [Andrew Haji](/scene/people/andrew-haji/) (Rodolfo) tested positive within a week of opening night, which necessitated the import of tenor Adam Luther to step into the role on short notice. Thankfully, opening night proceeded as planned, the behind-the-scenes drama having no perceived effect on the company’s triumphant, “all-the-feels” return to the mainstage that will make even the most fickle patron fall in love with the story all over again.

The strength of Bohème is understandably rooted in its core ensemble of Bohemians. Edmonton Opera has assembled a strong sextet who drive the story convincingly throughout the four acts. On this night, Adam Luther stood and delivered a passionate Rodolfo – complete with a soaring high C in the famed “Che galida” aria at the end of the first Act. His bright vocal timbre matched well with his castmates, especially those of Peter Barrett’s Marcello and Miriam Khalil’s Mimi. I can only imagine the adrenaline coursing through him on opening night, with less than a week to prepare the role both vocally and on the stage, but Luther showed his mettle and resolve by treating the audience with an unforgettable performance.

Note: Andrew Haji is slated to return as Rodolfo for the remaining two performances, February 8 and 11, in what will mark his company debut with Edmonton Opera. I’m eager to see Haji perform with this production because he spent much time preparing and staging the role before being sidelined. Despite the pandemic, Haji has been one of Canada’s most sought-after tenors - his February 2020 performance as Pollione in the Calgary Opera production of Bellini’s Norma was praised for his lyric beauty and carrying power – attributes that will surely serve him well in the role of Rodolfo.

This is the second time I have seen soprano Miriam Khalil as Mimi and I hope it’s not the last, especially now that she is based in Edmonton. On this night, Khalil was one of the stronger performances of the evening, impressing with her versatility as her character’s health declines through the opera. Her strong vocals never waned, even when her character is in its final moments, which demonstrates her respect for Puccini’s music above all else. On this night, Khalil sang the Act III aria “Donde lieta usci” especially well: she captures both Mimi’s love for Rodolfo and the agony of parting ways with him. This is a role Khalil knows well: she played Mimi with Calgary Opera in 2019, as well as for the Canadian Opera Company and Minnesota Opera.
