We're pretty pumped for Michael Pecak, the conductor and fortepianist who's also a Schmopera contributor!

Next month, Pecak will make his principal conducting debut with Chicago Opera Theatre, in the world premiere of _The Beekeeper_. The opera is a one-act with music by Wang Lu and a libretto by Kelley Rourke that hints at mystery and a bit of spookiness.

_The Beekeeper_ is part of COT's Vanguard Initiative, where the company fosters promising composers - including mentorship from Jake Heggie - and fosters new opera with Vanguard Composer Mentor Jake Heggie.

The premiere — directed by Jerre Dye and with Pecak on the podium — happens on March 4, 7:30pm at the Athenaeum Theater in Chicago.
