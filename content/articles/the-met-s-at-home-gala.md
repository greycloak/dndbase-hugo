The Metropolitan Opera has been home to plenty of history over its lifespan, and today is another day for the books. Over 40 of the Met's artists banded together - via Skype - to create the _At-Home Gala_, a four-hour marathon of performances given from everyone's respective homes. Those 40+ don't account for the performances by the Met Orchestra and the Met Chorus, which were pre-recorded ahead of the occasion; some big kudos should go to the Met staff who organized all of this, because despite all the moving parts, the (nearly) all live event went smoothly.

It was admittedly a bit weird at times. Weird to see Jonas Kaufmann sing in jeans. Weird to watch Elīna Garanča use her bookcase as a sexy Habanera set piece. What was the story behind the strange bust sitting on the piano behind Anthony Roth Costanzo? Calleja standing stage-right of a big fish tank? For some reason I am spending a lot of time wondering about the mystery item laying askew on Matthew Polenzani's couch.

* this is weird
* the interest factor lies in how these guys are going to pull it off, because this is not their medium, not what they've trained for
* plus snooping into homes
* DiDonato looks fake and disingenuous
* Kaufmann in jeans! Exciting and in great voice, a strange let-down of silence after each number
* a weird result of the HD broadcasts is catching an up-close look at something that was never really meant to be seen up close. It's like meeting your idols, seeing the wig lines, the sweat, the clumsy glances at the conductor, the over-acting, the fakeness of a set - on one hand it's a fascinating inside look, and on the other hand it doesn't always show the art well - has to be the right opera
* same with these - has to be the right artist
* this is for the existing fans, no doubt - this gala isn't scooping up new opera lovers, I don't think
* Erin Morley accompanying herself for Chacun le sait - nice -high F, easy performance, true star
* Armiliato and Ambrogio together?? fucking boomers
* There's something unnerving about being sung at - some strange rep choices, not everyone seems to get what it means to put on a damn show/gala
* Garanca using her bookcase as a set piece for Habanera - fun
* in this context, these people aren't always distinct from "average" people, it's hard to appreciate their talent
* Angel Blue - used to the camera, you can tell she's done this sort of thing before
* Quinn Kelsey - suave, easy voice
* Rene Pape is charming, Alec Baldwin-y face and gorgeous impressive voice
* **we wanna see tricks! Pape's low notes, Morley's high F, etc.
* ildar abdrazakov is fun
* picking rep - it's like performing for an opera pub - not everything reads the way you hope/think
* ARC is cute, slightly annoying/ON - who's the bust behind him??
* what do we learn? Opera singers are intense! And very different as individuals, some dorky, some nervous about the new medium, some relishing it
* Sonja sounds great - find your mark!
* Nadine is great, 
* it's a bit of an inside love-fest here, saying hi to friends etc
* Damrau/Testé duet is fun, they can actually act off each other
* hard to balance the sense of feeling out of touch, humble braggy, ignorant about how lucky they are, but you also know shit is possibly dire for them and in that case it feels disingenuous
* where's Etienne/Nicole? oh no! Skype issues
* staging a home scene is harder than you'd think - make-up, background, doing a duet scene sitting down together? how awkward (Ailyn/Howard)
* Camarena is charming
* all of the sub-par stuff must be forgiven - sound quality, "set design", the framing/cinematography, it's all equalized like everything else during this pandemic. So, what we're left with is charisma/showmanship/communication/star quality/
