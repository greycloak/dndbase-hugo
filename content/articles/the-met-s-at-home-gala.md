The Metropolitan Opera has been home to plenty of history over its lifespan, and today is another day for the books. Over 40 of the Met's artists banded together - via Skype - to create the _At-Home Gala_, a four-hour marathon of performances given from everyone's respective homes. Those 40+ don't account for the performances by the Met Orchestra and the Met Chorus, which were pre-recorded ahead of the occasion; some big kudos should go to the Met staff who organized all of this, because despite all the moving parts, the (nearly) all live event went smoothly.

It was admittedly a bit weird at times. Weird to see Jonas Kaufmann sing in jeans. Weird to watch Elīna Garanča use her bookcase as a sexy Habanera set piece. What was the story behind the strange bust sitting on the piano behind Anthony Roth Costanzo? Calleja standing stage-right of a big fish tank? For some reason I am spending a lot of time wondering about the mystery item laying askew on Matthew Polenzani's couch.

But for a snoopy snoop like me, there were serious moments of charm with the _At-Home Gala_. We got little glimpses into these people's worlds - curated and tidied up for the occasion, I'm sure. Renée Fleming's airy living room, Nadine Sierra's foliage-filled space, and the delish kitchen of Diana Damrau and Nicolas Testé. It was fascinating to see which of these stage animals relish the virtual medium - not all of them did, I surmise.

Now is no time to look down on feats like this one, because it really was an amazing thing to witness. I wonder about a few things, though. Did the Met consider making this a ticketed event? I bet people would have paid for something like this, and the imperiled company could pocket a bit of fundraising - or even, (and here goes one of the more naïve things I've ever written) send the money back to the participating artists. And speaking of the participating artists - I wonder very loudly how they felt about doing this for no fee, particularly those who found out about their cancelled Met contracts through social media posts. It's quite something for Peter Gelb to not call his contracted artists when COVID-19 shut everything down, and then ask them to come help "Save The Met" with a free performance at home. Yikes.

I'm not sure that the Met meant to reveal itself in this particular way, but I came away from this gala with a fresh understanding of what kind of opera will survive after all of this calms down. It won't be the kind of opera where people gaze off into some random distance, trying to emote depth when really they just look pretentious. It won't be the kind of opera where we are hollered at through unnerving virtual eye-contact. And I'm sorry, it won't be the kind of opera that Anna Netrebko gives us. She's definitely a big draw and I'm sure people were itching to hear her; it's a shame that she gave us something pre-recorded and all about Anna, without a whiff of the home-performance charm, and still managed to situate herself as a grand finale. 

Star power is something that absolutely is transferable from stage to screen. Soprano Erin Morley gave us a damn show - she accompanied herself doing "Chacun le sait" from _Le fille du régiment_, and gave us something impressive, elastic, and ending with an ovation-worthy high F. René Pape made a damn connection - he's got that Alec Baldwin-y look about him, and delivered Sarastro's first aria from _The Magic Flute_ like some sort of storytelling elder. 

* this is weird
* the interest factor lies in how these guys are going to pull it off, because this is not their medium, not what they've trained for
* plus snooping into homes
* DiDonato looks fake and disingenuous
* Kaufmann in jeans! Exciting and in great voice, a strange let-down of silence after each number
* a weird result of the HD broadcasts is catching an up-close look at something that was never really meant to be seen up close. It's like meeting your idols, seeing the wig lines, the sweat, the clumsy glances at the conductor, the over-acting, the fakeness of a set - on one hand it's a fascinating inside look, and on the other hand it doesn't always show the art well - has to be the right opera
* same with these - has to be the right artist
* this is for the existing fans, no doubt - this gala isn't scooping up new opera lovers, I don't think
* Erin Morley accompanying herself for Chacun le sait - nice -high F, easy performance, true star
* Armiliato and Ambrogio together?? fucking boomers
* There's something unnerving about being sung at - some strange rep choices, not everyone seems to get what it means to put on a damn show/gala
* Garanca using her bookcase as a set piece for Habanera - fun
* in this context, these people aren't always distinct from "average" people, it's hard to appreciate their talent
* Angel Blue - used to the camera, you can tell she's done this sort of thing before
* Quinn Kelsey - suave, easy voice
* Rene Pape is charming, Alec Baldwin-y face and gorgeous impressive voice
* **we wanna see tricks! Pape's low notes, Morley's high F, etc.
* ildar abdrazakov is fun
* picking rep - it's like performing for an opera pub - not everything reads the way you hope/think
* ARC is cute, slightly annoying/ON - who's the bust behind him??
* what do we learn? Opera singers are intense! And very different as individuals, some dorky, some nervous about the new medium, some relishing it
* Sonja sounds great - find your mark!
* Nadine is great, 
* it's a bit of an inside love-fest here, saying hi to friends etc
* Damrau/Testé duet is fun, they can actually act off each other
* hard to balance the sense of feeling out of touch, humble braggy, ignorant about how lucky they are, but you also know shit is possibly dire for them and in that case it feels disingenuous
* where's Etienne/Nicole? oh no! Skype issues
* staging a home scene is harder than you'd think - make-up, background, doing a duet scene sitting down together? how awkward (Ailyn/Howard)
* Camarena is charming
* all of the sub-par stuff must be forgiven - sound quality, "set design", the framing/cinematography, it's all equalized like everything else during this pandemic. So, what we're left with is charisma/showmanship/communication/star quality/
