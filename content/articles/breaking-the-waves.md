* in love young woman coming off as majorly naive in front of a bunch of Scottish dudes...yikes - xenophobia plus misogyny
* great music for Jan's entrance - smearing strings foreshadow
* we get a whiff of their relationship right away "late late late!"
* John Moore as Jan - unbelievably beautiful baritone
* Scottish accent a funny thing permeating the show - Marcus DeLoach's accent details stick out
* awkwardness right away, disenchantment - "silly little thing", shame over blood on dress
* the line about how all women must endure loneliness at some point - oof
* male chorus scene full of super thinly veiled innuendo - "drill deep, men" and "we dream oil" and "we drip oil, we shit oil, we breathe oil" and "suck up the crude" and "force it from the rock"
* money > desire > lust > women > sex jokes
* genius moments of writing, like how Missy does the "hello" repetition after their phone call
* she prays for him to come home, can't wait the 10 days, can't help herself from wishing he'd be home sooner - Eve moment, woman sets herself up for punishment because she admits to being horny/wanting something more than she has
* 

  ***
* great scene with Doctor (David Portillo)
* sort of strange, their obsession with their sex life during the obviously early time after the accident
* it's this great world where the people say out loud the thoughts that most people would have, even this soon after an accident
* all the ways a sex life can be so important to a couple; here, it's because it keeps up appearances in church/society, and because it makes each of them feel valued/valuable
* God says, prove that you love him and I won't let him die - so, do what he says and find someone else to have sex with, and he'll be spared; it starts to work, but only once she starts enjoying the sex
* women turn on her, because women do that
* this whole story is people telling Bess that they know what's best for her, better than she does
* then God stops answering - comes back
