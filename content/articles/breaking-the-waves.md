* in love young woman coming off as majorly naive in front of a bunch of Scottish dudes...yikes - xenophobia plus misogyny
* great music for Jan's entrance - smearing strings foreshadow
* we get a whiff of their relationship right away "late late late!"
* John Moore as Jan - unbelievably beautiful baritone
* Scottish accent a funny thing permeating the show - Marcus DeLoach's accent details stick out
* awkwardness right away, disenchantment - "silly little thing", shame over blood on dress
* the line about how all women must endure loneliness at some point - oof
*
