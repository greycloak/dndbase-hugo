Who else wants off the rollercoaster?!

Readers, if you're like me, you've become a hardened version of an opera fan. You swat away feelings of hope when you see a season announcement from a major company. You read about last-minute show cancellations  - or last-minute virtual pivots - with an audible amount of _yeah, seems about right_ in your resigned sigh.

If you watch the digital stuff, you with the resentful approach of my four-year-old when he puts his Lego collection away at a rate of one block per minute. _You're making me do this_, we grumble to Omicron, or to Rob Ford, or to the void.

Here in Canada, we're also noticing the flurry of activity across the pond. European companies are up and running, switching on and off for periodic closures as needed, thanks to their state funding models. And south of the border, it's the same deal. Masks are on in the US, but so are the shows. I figure the difference here is a combination of Canadian caution and a few politicians who completely and utterly suck and have zero place in their minds for the arts industry.

But strangely enough, we've gotten a glimpse of opera's future in Canada, and it's more conservative than ever. When the Canadian Opera Company announced a hybrid season that would feature in-person shows starting in February 2022, it was hard not to notice that the shows they unveiled were old standards (and COC-owned productions): Diane Paulus' _Magic Flute_, Arin Arbus' _Traviata_, that sort of thing.

Across Canada, it's a similar situation. Calgary's [_Merry Widow_](https://calgaryopera.com/21-22/merry-widow) opens this week, and its _Traviata_ will follow in April. Edmonton is rolling out [_Bohème_](https://www.edmontonopera.com/2022/boheme) next month, with _Così fan tutte_ soon after. In [Vancouver](https://www.vancouveropera.ca/), it was _Orfeo ed Euridice_, with _Cavalleria rusticana_ and _H.M.S. Pinafore_ on the 2022 horizon. In [Montreal](https://www.operademontreal.com/en/shows/2021-2022-season), it was going to be _Traviata_, but at least _Magic Flute_ is still in the plans.

Suuuuuper conservative. And the reasoning is clear: money is tighter than ever, artists can't travel as freely, and the best laid plans are subject to destruction at any moment. It's not the time to "gamble" on new opera, or even 21st-century opera, despite its exciting lurch toward real relevance in the last 10 years. It's not even the time to try out a fun new co-production, apparently. I imagine donors are dropping away, and the wiggle room for adventure seems razor-thin.

It's just... not landing right. Or not for me, anyway. We've always craved art that says something about the world around us, and as much as we may love them, these operas don't offer much to say about a COVID-stricken society. 

And yes, before you correct me: I do see that innovation is coming via digital projects. These are adventurous, self-aware pieces of new opera that seem to speak personally to real opera fans who are art-starved. These digital works are promising, and I hope they start to move to the live stage. 

After all, one can really sense a company's artistic priorities by what they put on their in-person mainstage.

I hope I'm not the only arts-friendly person who still struggles to care about the performing arts. Not about the artists and their need to be employed, but about the performances themselves.

It's almost hilarious to consider, after the two years we've all just had with all the destruction and loneliness and dismay, showing up to the theatre for a _Traviata_. In the before times, I was all for stories that swept me out of reality; now, it feels like a tone-deaf version of artistic gaslighting to expect that a great high note can affect us with the same ease that it did before we all lost ourselves to a public health emergency.

I don't know who I'm so angry at, but I just want to say to someone: _Our art needs to be honest, and opera is not being honest. It's not the fault of these tried-and-true works that they exist in worlds without COVID-19, but I don't have any room to care about them right now. Tell me a story about isolation or ruined holidays or deep worries for our children, then I might perk up._

Here's a little story for you:

For one of my Master's degree recitals (hay, Don Wright Faculty of Music!) I programmed Beethoven's [Cello Sonata No. 3 in A Major, Op. 69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9pivx91mVk). As I practiced and practiced, I noticed that for an opus sixty-nine, the thing sounded pretty darn rudimentary. Like, closer to Haydn and Telemann than anything Beethoven is known for. This Cello Sonata is super tonal with clear structural guidelines, full of the kind of safe rule-following that's very weird when we consider that by this point, Beethoven had already written his Eroica Symphony and both the Waldstein _and_ Appassionata Piano Sonatas.

What was with the shift backwards, I wondered? Turns out: he was going deaf. Beethoven wrote the A Major Cello Sonata around 1808, a handful of years after he started losing his hearing. And if you were a revolutionary composer who could no longer trust his ears, what would you do? You'd trust music theory, and you'd write what works on paper. At least until you get used to writing without your ears, and you finally branch out again and end up with a [_Grosse Fugue_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosse_Fuge)_._

The history nerd in me was thrilled to have found a reason - or at least a plausible theory - why Beethoven went from bold to safe so abruptly, mid-way through his career. But the human in me was heartbroken that there was this trail of breadcrumbs in Beethoven's composing, where we could (ironically) hear the man go deaf, go from bold innovator to timid form-follower.

I remembered that story when piecing together my thoughts on the current state of things in Canada's opera scene. It seems that, out of necessity, we're going with better-safe-than-sorry. I understand the position; I just mourn the fact that it's because we're in precarious health.

It's worth remembering that Beethoven's conservatism, brought on by deafness, was only temporary. He went on to write the _Missa Solemnis_ and the _Ninth Symphony_, after all; maybe we're in for a fresh bout of revolution?

Readers, what do you think? Is conservation savvy these days? Does it signal a hoarding of resources, ready to use with abandon and imagination once it's safe to go back to the opera? Or, does it usher in a new age of low-risk, donor-appeasing rinse-and-repeat of _Carmen_, _Flute_, _Traviata_, and _Bohème_?
