Who else wants off the rollercoaster?!

Readers, if you're like me, you've become a hardened version of an opera fan. You swat away feelings of hope when you see a season announcement from a major company. You read about last-minute show cancellations  - or last-minute virtual pivots - with an audible amount of _yeah, seems about right_ in your resigned sigh. If you watch the digital stuff, you with the resentful approach of my four-year-old when he puts his Lego collection away at a rate of one block per minute. _You're making me do this_, we grumble to Omicron, or to Rob Ford, or to the void.

Here in Canada, we're also noticing the flurry of activity across the pond. Companies are up and running, switching on and off for periodic closures as needed, thanks to their state funding models. And south of the border, it's the same deal. Masks are on, but so are the shows. I figure it's a combination of Canadian caution and a few politicians who completely and utterly suck and have zero place in their minds for the arts industry.

But strangely enough, we've gotten a glimpse of opera's future in Canada, and it's more conservative than ever. When the Canadian Opera Company announced a hybrid season that would feature in-person shows starting in February, it was hard not to notice that the shows they unveiled were old standards (and COC-owned productions): Diane Paulus' _Magic Flute_, Arin Arbus' _Traviata_, that sort of thing.

Across Canada, it's a similar situation. Calgary's [_Merry Widow_](https://calgaryopera.com/21-22/merry-widow) opens this week, and its _Traviata_ will follow in April. Edmonton is rolling out [_Bohème_](https://www.edmontonopera.com/2022/boheme) next month, with _Così fan tutte_ soon after. In [Vancouver](https://www.vancouveropera.ca/), it was _Orfeo ed Euridice_, with _Cavalleria rusticana_ and _H.M.S. Pinafore_ on the 2022 horizon. In [Montreal](https://www.operademontreal.com/en/shows/2021-2022-season), it was going to be _Traviata_, but at least _Magic Flute_ is still in the plans. 

Suuuuuper conservative. But the reasoning is clear: money is tighter than ever, artists can't travel as freely, and the best laid plans are subject to destruction at any moment. It's not the time to "gamble" on new opera, or even 21st-century opera, despite its exciting lurch toward real relevance in the last 10 years. 

It's almost hilarious to consider sitting through a _Traviata_ after the two years we've all just had. It feels like a niche form of gaslighting, to arrive at the theatre after all the destruction and loneliness and dismay and be shown something so clearly from another time. It's as though there's an expectation that a great high note can whisk us away to fantasy-land with the same ease that it did before we all lost ourselves to a public health emergency. 

Here's a little anecdote for you:

For one of my Master's degree recitals (hay, Don Wright Faculty of Music!) I programmed Beethoven's 

Seasons announced, shows pivoted last-minute to virtual because Omicron, boo.
