Though I have a complicated relationship with all this freely streamed opera happening from houses worldwide, I can admit that I voraciously consumed LA Opera's most recent LAO at Home presentation, _Angel's Bone_. The Pulitzer Prize-winning opera by composer Du Yun and librettist [Royce Vavrek](/jacqueline-come-for-the-music-stay-for-everything-else/) was supposed to go up as part of LAO's Off Grand series, but in lieu of _Angel's Bone_ live, they've offered up the 2018 production from the Hong Kong New Vision Arts Festival. 

It's a good consolation prize. The Hong Kong production features the cast and creative team that was set for Los Angeles; for the most part, it's this team that has seen _Angel's Bone_ through since in 2016 premiere at New York's PROTOTYPE Festival.
