Though I have a [complicated relationship](/what-the-mets-at-home-gala-teaches-us-about-evolution/) with all this freely streamed opera happening from houses worldwide, I can admit that I voraciously consumed LA Opera's most recent LAO at Home presentation, _Angel's Bone_. The Pulitzer Prize-winning opera by composer Du Yun and librettist [Royce Vavrek](/jacqueline-come-for-the-music-stay-for-everything-else/) was supposed to go up as part of LAO's Off Grand series, but in lieu of _Angel's Bone_ live, they've offered up the 2018 production from the Hong Kong New Vision Arts Festival.

It's a good consolation prize. The Hong Kong production features the cast and creative team that was set for Los Angeles; for the most part, it's this team that has seen _Angel's Bone_ through since in 2016 premiere at New York's PROTOTYPE Festival. 

This opera is hard on the heart. Two angels, nostalgic for earthy life, make the long journey back to the mortal world. When Mr. and Mrs. X.E. discover the angels in their garden, they are in the thick of the stress and mutual resentment that comes out of financial worries and an untended marriage. The couple "prune" the angels - hacking off their wings in a terrorizing scene of violence - and commodify them, selling them as sexual and spiritual slaves for men and women who are into that sort of angelic experience.

_Angel's Bone_, frankly, fucked me up. The opera is so rich with dramatic checkpoints that it's hard to pinpoint exactly when you're swept away by the story, but it's within the first minutes. There are delicious layers in the X.E.'s, particularly the arc of Mrs. X.E. (Abigail Fischer) and her bored-housewife introduction that reads like a bleak, bizarro-world version of Dinah in _Trouble in Tahiti_. She goes from banal victim to vicious trafficker seemingly on a dime, with a pointed dose of abusive behaviour that erased all hope of her character getting any sympathy from me.

But it was the Girl and Boy Angels that got me the most. I'm not even sure where to start, since it was in the Angels' scenes that this opera felt its most cohesive, as though no element could be pried away from another. The two characters are brilliantly created, childlike and slightly off - a fascinating take on the concept of otherworldly beings. The way they speak, move, the sounds of their voices, it's all a bit unnatural, just unfamiliar enough to give me the heebie-jeebies. And these singers, holy shit. Kyle Biefield as the Boy Angel uses his voice in a truly unreal way, with actually awesome power and extreme ranges and colour spectra for days; and paired with his physicality, which starts off as naive and loving before diving into traumatized and abused, is completely heart-wrenching. And Rosie K as the Girl Angel, her voice drew me right in. She's not an opera singer - or at least she doesn't sing like one - and the breathy brittleness in her first words added to that whole thing of, _what are angels actually like? Are they these weird innocent aliens?_ She certainly expands beyond sounding fragile, in a solo display that sets a new bar for operatic mad scenes.

I can't tell if it was this glorious casting that made these characters so horrifying and compelling, or if it was the way they were written by Du Yun and Royce Vavrek. It's probably true that _Angel's Bone_ hits that white-whale mark, where collaborative creation leads to something greater than the sum of its parts. Honestly, in that scene where Mr. X.E. takes a cleaver to the angels' wings, I think I had an "aha" moment. I thought I'd experienced that thing where the story is excellent and the music makes it even more excellent, but this moment was something else entirely. Chaotic blasts of sound by Du Yun punctuate the angels' hair-raising screams of pain and fear and disbelief - that's some fucking opera right there. Christ.
