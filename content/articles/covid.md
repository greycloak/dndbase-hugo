Readers, what the %$&# just happened?!

The world is closed. Like, check-your-place-in-the-world, do-you-really-need-to-do-that-thing, what-does-your-mask-say-about-your-personality, closed. It's freaky how fast it happened, at least for me. I went to the office some day early last month, haven't been back since. Somewhere between March 10-13, my email was littered with press releases announcing cancellations from the Met downwards, and I was blinking like an idiot who couldn't grasp that maybe sometimes mass gatherings are dangerous.

Have you all started thinking about how small your personal worlds were, pre-COVID? Because I have. I'm a bit disappointed in myself that it took cancelled operas for me to appreciate the gravity of the situation, of all things. But I imagine that happened for everyone with their respective little worlds. Sports, travel, farmer's markets, patio season, all of it is off the table - and here in Canada, the end is not yet in sight.

All of a sudden my singer friends were throwing their lives into suitcases and scrambling to come home - wherever that is, or could feasibly be - before they found themselves income-less in a hub like Germany or Italy. The news became a flurry of statistics and updates and rising curves, mixed with the tough optics of opera companies announcing that they probably couldn't pay their artists after all. "Force majeure" landed fresh into our vernacular, as did "unprecedented" and "virtual opera".

It's all so effing confusing. Is there enough money to help all these artists _and_ the companies who could potentially hire them in the future? If we have to choose between one or the other, which is it? Do we let artists starve while preserving organizations, in the hopes that whenever this thing gets behind us, they can be the kindling to restart a stalled industry? Or do we make sure the actual people are alright, keeping them financially secure amid the worst of it, and kick down the road the question of whether there will be a place for them to work when things get safe out there?

How long before companies fold? We're about to find out plenty about the difference between a company with a big budget and a company with a solid cash flow. And how long could freelance artists realistically stay afloat?
