1. Sopranos, see thy teachers for this one. I mean, Verdi really kicks off this killer aria with an abyss of overthinking, a bar that looks-simple-but-it's-obviously-not-simple. I can encourage you all to keep refreshing your \[a\] vowel, to use Verdi's crescendo-diminuendo to your advantage, and have fun with a portamento on the way down (at least a little one!). But remember: we've only just begun...

2. Take care here with intonation. It's easy to go flat on the B-flat, and the G on "mio Dio". And though it's relatively simple, take care not to let your placement drop as you come down. That leap from F to D should be easy, nothing more.
3. You have time to sing a real vowel on the first syllable of "sventura", so let it help you get into this new minor mode in this section. And Verdi does a cool thing here with the text phrasing; there's a tiny comma after "m'astringe", so give some fresh attention to the "ahim√®" that comes after it.

4. Be diligent that you don't fall flat on either of the E-flats in this phrase. And though the text oozes drama here, don't overdarken as you descend into speech-like territory.

5. Chat with your teacher about how to negotiate these diminuendos without losing spin. And rather than aiming for a specific volume level, go for contrast; it'll help you from coming off the voice in pursuit of a proper _piano_.
