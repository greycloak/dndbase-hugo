1. Sopranos, see thy teachers for this one. I mean, Verdi really kicks off this killer aria with an abyss of overthinking, a bar that looks-simple-but-it's-obviously-not-simple. I can encourage you all to keep refreshing your \[a\] vowel, to use Verdi's crescendo-diminuendo to your advantage, and have fun with a portamento on the way down (at least a little one!). But remember: we've only just begun...

2. Take care here with intonation. It's easy to go flat on the B-flat, and the G on "mio Dio". And though it's relatively simple, take care not to let your placement drop as you come down. That leap from F to D should be an easy tune, nothing more. And a general note: the dotted figures in this aria should be distinguishable from triplet figures. Classic Verdi.
3. You have time to sing a real vowel on the first syllable of "sventura", so let it help you get into this new minor mode in this section. And Verdi does a cool thing here with the text phrasing; there's a tiny comma after "m'astringe", so give some fresh attention to the "ahimè" that comes after it.

4. Be diligent that you don't fall flat on either of the E-flats in this phrase. And though the text oozes drama here, don't over-darken as you descend into speech-like territory.

5. Chat with your teacher about how to negotiate these diminuendos without losing spin. And rather than aiming for a specific volume level, go for contrast; it'll help you from coming off the voice in pursuit of a proper _piano_. 
6. Long, _long_ sound on "L'ami, gli è ver!" Note that "gli è" is under a straight eighth note, so don't be late on it. The melody is getting more interesting here, so show us around a bit and don't leave a single note out of your voice.

7. When you breathe for this phrase, plan it around this bar. Most sopranos like to snag a breath either before "cotanto" or before "l'ornò", to make the most out of this hairpin moment on "che l'amo ancor". And though it's not marked, it's a nice touch to add a bit of portamento from the D up to the F.
8. This rhythm is pretty cool, so keep it crisp and taut. When you breathe for the first "Fatalità!", make sure you're singing on that tiny sixteenth-note pickup. You won't really have time to vibrate on it, but you spin should be already happening.

Ok, enough talk! Time to listen...specifically to Montserrat Caballé singing this aria in Vienna, 1979:
