The Canadian Opera Company has officially launched its 2021-22 season, which is set to be a mix of digital and in-person offerings. The fall kicked off in style, with a concert of arias and orchestral highlights from opera’s big-guns: Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, and friends. The headlining artists: beloved Canadian baritone Russell Braun, and star American soprano Tamara Wilson, backed by COC Music Director Johannes Debus and the COC Orchestra.

Wilson sounds unreal, she’s so effing solid, detail-oriented but not in her head, just fucking sings the shit out of every score she gets. Orchestra did not match her energy, jeez

Braun always sounds gorgeous - I don’t know why there’s this push for him to sing Verdi, though. It’s just not him, it doesn’t show him at his best, maybe there was a sense that he needed to “match” Wilson’s Wagner

Commentary by Leech - fine as an opening, but this feels like an aged approach to creating a digital concert - we also have to get past this education-like commentary. Either program rep that doesn’t need preparation, or own it and just let the excellent singers do their jobs

Dapertutto! Such weird rep for him. High notes are great, even too high… and I suppose this is a choice Braun can make in this medium, with mics etc. But it’s just funny because the COC seems quite hell bent on reminding us of the FSC

Yay Wilson doing Nabucco! High C to two octaves down, no biggie. Kick-ass from start to finish, textbook, love it. C’s just keep getting better 

“Wow, that makes you shiver, doesn’t it?”

Pierrot from Braun is luscious and lovely and what we want, yay.

Nice dance-like touches from Debus and orchestra

Tosca is a fun fit for Wilson

Wolfram sits nicely, it’s almost too low for Braun at times

This concert is the Tamara show, and I’m here for it - Leonora and Isolde back to back is a fine flex

I loved her Desdemona so much, I thought I’d be more excited for her Verdi, but I’m really really pumped to hear this Wagner. I’m dying to hear her in an Isolde soon… But yeah, a huge level of care with each note, then smoothed over into something human and inspired and real, never cerebral

Her Isolde is just stunning, makes me stop what I’m doing, as it should.
