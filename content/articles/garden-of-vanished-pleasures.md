* fascinating music: mix of cabaret, crowded trio harmonies, chant-like text delivery, hard to pin down an aesthetic, other than it's text-driven, and backed with a really colourful chamber ensemble, which tells us that he is scared, lonely, sick, horny, ashamed
* composers Livingston and McKevitt 
* available through Oct 10
* I keep feeling Peter Grimes/Britten vibes - maybe it's the English seaside setting, the wave projections, the isolation/gay man thing
* I'm super curious to know which of the texts are by Jarman, but it's cool that I can't always figure it out
*
