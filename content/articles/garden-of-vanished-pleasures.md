Before it's gone, make sure you delve into the curious world devised by Tim Albery in his world-premiere production for Soundstreams, _Garden of Vanished Pleasures_.

It's hard to pinpoint why _Garden_ draws you in, because it's a sum-of-its-parts sort of work. The story is compelling: real-life filmmaker, artist, and queer-rights activist [Derek Jarman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jarman) lives out his final years as an HIV-positive man, tending to his gardens at Prospect Cottage on England's southwest seaside. The music, songs composed by Cecilia Livingston and Donna McKevitt, set texts taken from Jarman's journals. It's all delivered by an excellent foursome of singers — countertenor Daniel Cabena (Derek Jarman), sopranos Mireille Asselin and Lindsay McIntyre, and mezzo-soprano Rebecca Cuddy — and a chamber trio of Brenna Corner on viola, Amahl Arulanandam on cello, and music director Rachael Kerr on piano.

The story is about love and lust and gender and isolation, all packed into the vantage point of a man living a stigmatic life, watching helplessly as his friends die from AIDS. The multi-faceted story is echoed in the musical styles, which are certainly varied, if nebulous. The minimalist, still aesthetic feels like a waiting room; the crowded trio harmonies signal the tension of being at once scared, lonely, horny, sick, and alone with one's troubling thoughts; the cabaret-style moments nod to Jarman's life as a queer activist.

Cabena is surely a perfect fit to portray Jarman. His countertenor voice is filled with layered meanings, hidden commentary about gender and strangeness and oppressive societal limits.

* fascinating music: mix of cabaret, crowded trio harmonies, chant-like text delivery, hard to pin down an aesthetic, other than it's text-driven, and backed with a really colourful chamber ensemble, which tells us that he is scared, lonely, sick, horny, ashamed
* composers Livingston and McKevitt
* available through Oct 10
* I keep feeling Peter Grimes/Britten vibes - maybe it's the English seaside setting, the wave projections, the isolation/gay man thing
* I'm super curious to know which of the texts are by Jarman, but it's cool that I can't always figure it out
* like a good British drama, it's a subtle burn - dark and muted colours, shadowy lighting, stark Albery aesthetic, but it's still intriguing and slowly sucks in your attention
* lovely singing out of all four: David Cabena is a stunning figure, backed by a fabulous trio in Mireille Asselin, Lindsay McIntyre, and Rebecca Cuddy
