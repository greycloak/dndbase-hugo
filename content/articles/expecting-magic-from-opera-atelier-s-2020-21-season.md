Opera Atelier has unveiled its season line-up for 2020-21, with all the pomp and creative excitement we're used to from the 35-year-old company that specializes in opera from the 17th and 18th centuries (and sometimes, early 19th...shh).

Co-Artistic Directors Marshall Pynkoski and Jeannette Lajeunesse Zingg announced the 35th anniversary season: Mozart's _The Magic Flute_ (Oct. 22-Nov. 1, 2020) and a double-bill of Purcell's _Dido and Aeneas_ and Edwin Huizinga's _The Angel Speaks_ (February 20-27, 2021) - the latter a commission by Opera Atelier that does indeed gather together the baroque and the contemporary.

There's also a bonus item slated for July 2, 2020. Through special invitation by Canadian pianist Angela Hewitt, artists of the Opera Atelier Ballet, and OA veteran soprano Mireille Asselin, will join Hewitt in performance at the Trasimeno Festival in Italy.
