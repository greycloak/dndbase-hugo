1. The music here is so darn great, it's one of opera's great adrenaline rushes. Throughout this whole section, keep a swinging feeling of 2/2; it'll be much more freeing than the 4/4 that's actually marked, and it'll keep you from falling into the trap of dragging the tempo. Some baritones holler this section, citing Rigoletto's seething rage in this scene. I implore you, baritones, to sing it beautifully, and let the text and music do the dramatic work for you. This section is so powerful when you sing each note, including in the vicious dotted rhythms. Even more important are the non-dotted rhythms, like in "vil razza" - that's an important detail that relays rage more effectively than any baritonal woofing could.

2\. In the practice room, try out lines like these without the dotted rhythms, as though each note value is the same. It'll make sure you know where the D-natural sits on "mia", and that C-sharp in the middle of "impagabil". This kind of detailed work is what creates that super important _bel canto_ legato, and ensures that you're singing every note with an actual vowel.

3\. sing through the rests, let us hear the A-natural. hear the d-flat in questa

4\. Speechy, all a big lead-up, not a place to spend

5\. shift in pitch from C creates a cry in sound. Whether or not you breathe after the Ah, sing small notes, stay light on piango

6\. Be ready for a new tessitura here. Give yourself more time for the E-flat, get there early.

7\. Speechy again, don't spend, let it get easier as it descends.

8\. Bel canto ready. Be set for the D-flat when you breathe for this phrase. Grace note doesn't have to be fast, hear it and sing it. Take the hairpins literally, especially the diminuendo.

1. Totally tricky, consult teacher immediately. Take special care with third of each triplet, especially the G-natural and G-flat. For high G-flat, you can take plenty of time, just snap back into it by the next downbeat.

1. Cadenza! Consult teacher for approaching low C, can be a grinder if you haven't been careful, but you don't want to start sitting down there before a high F. Be picky with chromatics, feel where they spin, sing through the glide in the last pieta.
