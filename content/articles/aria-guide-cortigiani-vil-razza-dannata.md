1. The music here is so darn great, it's one of opera's great adrenaline rushes. Throughout this whole section, keep a swinging feeling of 2/2; it'll be much more freeing than the 4/4 that's actually marked, and it'll keep you from falling into the trap of dragging the tempo. Some baritones holler this section, citing Rigoletto's seething rage in this scene. I implore you, baritones, to sing it beautifully, and let the text and music do the dramatic work for you. This section is so powerful when you sing each note, including in the vicious dotted rhythms. Even more important are the non-dotted rhythms, like in "vil razza" - that's an important detail that relays rage more effectively than any baritonal woofing could.

2\. In the practice room, try out lines like these without the dotted rhythms, as though each note value is the same. It'll make sure you know where the D-natural sits on "mia", and that C-sharp in the middle of "impagabil". This kind of detailed work is what creates that super important _bel canto_ legato, and ensures that you're singing every note with an actual vowel.

3. Despite the rests, this is still one long phrase; let the text lead you, not the silences, and beware the bad habit of taking a breath each time there's a rest. Wherever you have longer notes - "pur", "questa", "fora" - remind yourself of what vowel you're singing; it's easy to let vowels get vague, so think of renewing, or repeating the vowel as you keep it spinning. On "Questa man", really sing that D-flat, because it's a great note.
4. This is a section to coast, not spend. This should feel speech-like, not like you're hyperventilating. Think of these three bars as a big lead-up to "Ah!"

5. Verdi slows the tempo here, just in time for a dramatic shift into the world of weeping. When Rigoletto says, "Marullo, Signore", it should feel utterly pitiable. The effect is amplified by being really picky about the rhythm; note that you're singing straight eighth notes, against the orchestra's triplets. At "Tu ch'hai l'alma..." let the crescendo help you spin that whole phrase.
6. This phrase can surprise you, so at "Dimmi tu" make sure you're breathing for the higher tessitura in the next bar.

7\. It's another speech-like section here, one that shouldn't wear you out. Beware of sipping breaths in each rest, and keep some lightness in your sound as you descend, so you don't relax too soon. Hint: there's a high F coming up! (And in case you're wondering: I didn't put in an entry for "tu taci" because it's best left between you and your trusted teacher.)

8. Another great moment in opera, right here. Please, for the love of Verdi, make sure you're vibrating on this pickup - including the "si-" of "signori". We're into full-throttle _bel canto_ here, and you've got lots of help with the crescendo and diminuendo up and down from the D-flat. Verdi gives you lots of these tools, so take them literally, for your own sake.

9. Verdi gives you a proper portamento here, so enjoy carrying the \[i\] vowel up to that D-flat. Don't skip the sixteenth note on "voi"; if you've taken a wise breath before "Ridonarla", that "voi" should help you up to the E-flat. And with those pesky slurred staccatos on "a voi nulla ora", consider them deliberate, rather than detached. The orchestra can do detached - you do _bel canto_.

10. Verdi marks _col canto_ here  Score details: crescendo here, phrase markings and portamenti marked, pp and portamento in second line.

1. Totally tricky, consult teacher immediately. Take special care with third of each triplet, especially the G-natural and G-flat. For high G-flat, you can take plenty of time, just snap back into it by the next downbeat.

1. Cadenza! Consult teacher for approaching low C, can be a grinder if you haven't been careful, but you don't want to start sitting down there before a high F. Be picky with chromatics, feel where they spin, sing through the glide in the last pieta.
