Over the weekend the Metropolitan Opera announced that it "can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him." It's a small gesture of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and I'll admit I'm surprised by the decisive action from of opera's big old institutions, even pleasantly so.

In a sly move, general manager Peter Gelb is letting the opera world ponder for itself who might be the subject of the Met's newly severed ties. Gelb does elaborate to _The New York Times_ about the Met's upcoming production of _Lohengrin_, which was supposed to us sets and costumes from the Bolshoi. "We’re scrambling, but I think we’ll have no choice but to physically build our own sets and costumes," Mr. Gelb told _The New York Times_, adding that  the Met's five-year relationship with the Bolshoi would be lost in the "collateral damage" of Putin's actions.

Are artists political?
