Over the weekend the Metropolitan Opera announced that it "can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him." It's a small gesture of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and I'll admit I'm surprised by the decisive action from of opera's big old institutions, even pleasantly so.

In a sly move, general manager Peter Gelb is letting the opera world ponder for itself who might be the subject of the Met's newly severed ties. Gelb does elaborate to _The New York Times_ about the Met's upcoming production of _Lohengrin_, which was supposed to us sets and costumes from the Bolshoi. "We’re scrambling, but I think we’ll have no choice but to physically build our own sets and costumes," Mr. Gelb told _The New York Times_, adding that  the Met's five-year relationship with the Bolshoi would be lost in the "collateral damage" of Putin's actions.

As for the rest of these artists supporting or supported by Putin, everyone is assuming the Met means conductor Valery Gergiev and soprano Anna Netrebko, both of whom have ties to Putin and haven't been great about condemning the Russian leader's invasion of Ukraine. Gergiev has already been dropped by Carnegie Hall and his own management, and if he doesn't denounce the invasion by today, he'll be fired from his post at the Munich Philharmonic.

Netrebko has endorsed Putin in his election campaign, [suggested](https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/02/15/146942131/around-the-classical-internet-february-17-2012) she was attracted to his "strong, male energy", and was photographed with pro-Russian separatist leader Oleg Tsaryov, holding a separatist flag. She is set to sing in the [Met's _Turandot_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/turandot/) starting April 30, and I suppose that's when we'll know for sure whether Gelb is prepared to keep one of his few actual stars off the stage in the name of human decency.

It sure does seem like Netrebko is at risk for losing some major professional relationships, and she's understandably pissed about it. She wrote on Sunday, "Forcing artists, or any public figure, to voice their political opinions in public and to denounce their homeland is not right," she wrote on Sunday. "I am not an expert in politics. I am an artist and my purpose is to unite people across political divides."

She says she is "opposed to this war", that she has friends in Ukraine "and the pain and suffering right now breaks my heart."

It's not that her argument isn't valid -- I do think we have a bad habit of expecting fully fleshed-out political opinions from famous people -- but it's still a lot of words to say when those words don't include, "Putin's actions are wrong."

So, look. In my opinion, Anna has been bad for the industry for a long time. It's all well and good to be a a Netrebko: you love to be onstage (read: need to be onstage), you take your art really seriously, you step with ease into the role of the modern-day diva, and you do nothing but exude glamour - reality be damned!

But putting all of that up against the last decade is tough to justify. For example: When Netrebko [posted a selfie](https://www.instagram.com/p/BydFhzEHR1l/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) in dark makeup as Aida and followers commented about blackface and racism, she responded with toilet emojis. Super charming. 

That preceded her response to the pandemic, which was full of complaining about socially distanced audiences and vague campaigns to ["#brackequarantine" because of a crowded airplane.](/guys-stop-telling-people-to-breakquarantine-because-of-a-crowded-plane/) That's right: when the opera world was completely decimated by the pandemic, one of the industry's few stars with good earnings and lots of professional influence uses her platform not to model the kind of behaviour that might get us out of the darkness as quickly as possible, but to berate public heath restrictions and spread garbage information to her followers. 

For what it's worth, I don't think it's fair to superimpose political expectations upon artists. It really isn't what they signed up for, and we shouldn't necessarily put weight in what they have to say on global affairs.

At the same time, if you wear blackface in 2019, you've got to be quite stubborn indeed not to apologize for it. And if you insist that going to the opera shouldn't be interrupted by a pandemic, I think that you show a really low level of humility. 

And: If you're giving off a pro-Putin vibe to the point where the Met is willing to professionally break up with you, how hard is it to condemn his invasion of Ukraine? 

Anyway. Does the ends justify the means her
