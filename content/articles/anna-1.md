Over the weekend the Metropolitan Opera announced that it "can no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin or are supported by him." It's a small gesture of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and I'll admit I'm surprised by the decisive action from of opera's big old institutions, even pleasantly so.

In a sly move, general manager Peter Gelb is letting the opera world ponder for itself who might be the subject of the Met's newly severed ties. Gelb does elaborate to _The New York Times_ about the Met's upcoming production of _Lohengrin_, which was supposed to us sets and costumes from the Bolshoi. "We’re scrambling, but I think we’ll have no choice but to physically build our own sets and costumes," Mr. Gelb told _The New York Times_, adding that  the Met's five-year relationship with the Bolshoi would be lost in the "collateral damage" of Putin's actions.

As for the rest of these artists supporting or supported by Putin, everyone is assuming the Met means conductor Valery Gergiev and soprano Anna Netrebko, both of whom have ties to Putin and haven't been great about condemning the Russian leader's invasion of Ukraine. Gergiev has already been dropped by Carnegie Hall and his own management, and if he doesn't denounce the invasion by today, he'll be fired from his post at the Munich Philharmonic.

Netrebko has endorsed Putin in his election campaign, [suggested](https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/02/15/146942131/around-the-classical-internet-february-17-2012) she was attracted to his "strong, male energy", and was photographed with pro-Russian separatist leader Oleg Tsaryov, holding a separatist flag. She is set to sing in the [Met's _Turandot_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/turandot/) starting April 30, and I suppose that's when we'll know for sure whether Gelb is prepared to keep one of his few actual stars off the stage in the name of human decency.

It sure does seem like Netrebko is at risk for losing some major professional relationships, and she's understandably pissed about it. She wrote on Sunday, "Forcing artists, or any public figure, to voice their political opinions in public and to denounce their homeland is not right," she wrote on Sunday. "I am not an expert in politics. I am an artist and my purpose is to unite people across political divides."

She says she is "opposed to this war", that she has friends in Ukraine "and the pain and suffering right now breaks my heart."

It's not that her argument isn't valid -- I do think we have a bad habit of expecting fully fleshed-out political opinions from famous people -- but it's still a lot of words to say when those words don't include, "Putin's actions are wrong."

So, look. In my opinion, Anna has been bad for the industry for a long time. It's all well and good to be a a Netrebko: you love to be onstage (read: need to be onstage), you take your art really seriously, you step with ease into the role of the modern-day diva, and you do nothing but exude glamour - reality be damned!

But putting all of that up against the last decade is tough to justify. For example: When Netrebko posted a selfie in dark makeup as Aida and followers commented about blackface and racism, she responded with toilet emojis. Super charming. 

During the pandemic alone, Netrebko's priorities have been utterly out of whack: whinging on Instagram about socially distanced audiences and how stupid they are and how we should ["#breakquarantine"](/guys-stop-telling-people-to-breakquarantine-because-of-a-crowded-plane/), I suppose because she lives for the applause. I say "out of whack" because she's an actually wealthy, actually successful opera star who is able to financially survive the closures _and_ pick up more work since March 2020 than most of her colleagues could ever dream of. She out of all of us would be in the position to appreciate what she has and help circulate the information that will get us out of the darkness as quickly as possible. Nope, bitch about how things aren't like they were.

But I guess it really does come down to the question that Netrebko lobbed onto the field, the one about whether or not we should expect artist to have political opinions, and whether we do anything in response to those opinions. 

Are artists political?
