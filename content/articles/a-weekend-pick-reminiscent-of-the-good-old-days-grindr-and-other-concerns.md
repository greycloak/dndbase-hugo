Feel like checking out a queer comedic chamber opera this weekend? Me too. Thankfully, there's _Grindr (and other concerns)_, the new work by composer Marc Hoffeditz, librettist MJ Halberstadt, and director Ingrid Oslund.

The opera was originally slated for a live premiere at the Boston-area Chelsea Theater Works, but COVID-19 has spun the project to a self-produced online event. 

Viewers are asked to [sign up ahead of time](https://tinyurl.com/ybnvys2w), and they'll be sent a link to the performance.
