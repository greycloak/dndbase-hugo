It's not surprising that Vivek Shraya's debut play, _How to Fail as a Popstar_, is one of the most vulnerable things I've seen onstage. She's like a human tapestry of things that inherently come with vulnerability: writer, performer, recording artist, queer person, brown person, trans person, person from Edmonton, AB - these are personalities that, voluntarily or otherwise, subject themselves to criticism.

And that's exactly what you want in a one-woman show. _Popstar_ is self-explanatory in its title; it's an autobiography in vignettes, important memories from childhood to the present that add up to the Vivek Shraya currently in the spotlight at Canadian Stage (performances run through March 1). Hers is a story about a kid who earned positive feedback from singing in public, who had talent and a weakness for people who predicted her stardom; she did the half-brave, half-crazy thing of moving far away from home to be where the opportunities were, motivated by a hunger for success and fueled by a good dose of naïveté. She did all the scary things that are almost sure traps for someone with Shraya's desire for popstardom: spent way too much money way too soon on her career, trusted irresponsible people, got depressed, got a big break, fizzled, trucked on, remained unsatisfied.

Shraya tells the story that's so common it's almost unspoken - and ironically, it makes _How to Fail as a Popstar_ feel like a rarity. Amid performing arts circles, regardless of genre, it's almost too raw for someone who hasn't "made it" to discuss why they "failed". It's easy for us to digest wistful stories of bad producers or embarrassing live shows when they come from the super-famous, like the humbling anecdotes offered to fans by the Taylor Swifts and Lady Gagas of the world.
