## _All About My Mother_ - Pedro Almodovar

"Almodovar is an absolute genius, and for me, [this film](https://www.criterion.com/films/29569-all-about-my-mother) is his _magnum opus_. The performance of Antonia San Juan as Agrado is as delicious and fabulous as they come."

## _Boogie Nights_ - Paul Thomas Anderson

"I'm not sure how many times I've seen PTA's [epic portrait of the porn industry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/). Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg do some of my absolute favorite work here. And that parting shot!"

## _Bridesmaids_ - Paul Feig

"Probably my favorite comedy.  No matter how many times I see this movie, I can’t help but laugh my ass off.  I will go anywhere for Melissa McCarthy."

## _Fat Girl_ - Catherine Breillat

"I am a die-hard Catherine Breillat fan.  If you can get a copy of her controversial _Une vraie jeune fille_, do yourself a favor and see what all the fuss is/was about. It has definitely informed a lot of my writing. I'm recommending [_Fat Girl_](https://www.criterion.com/films/548-fat-girl), which I just re-watched a few days ago and continually blows my mind with every viewing.  And I welcome any opportunity to spend time watching the luminous Arsinée Khanjian.

## _Holy Motors_ - Leos Carax

"This is a wild, eccentric ride that will boggle and transport you to some dynamic vivid worlds.  An [all-out masterpiece](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076220/) featuring the performance of a lifetime from Denis Lavant.

## _In the Mood for Love_ - Wong Kar-wai

"Why not spend time with one of, if not the best film ever made? Those performances (Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung!), those costumes, the cinematography, that score. Wong Kar-Wai is everything.

## _Sense and Sensibility_ - Ang Lee

"I love Jane Austen.  I love Emma Thompson.  I love Kate Winslet.  I love Alan Rickman.  I love Greg Wise.  I love Hugh Grant.  I love Ang Lee.  I have the most amazing memory of my father taking me to the cinema in Grande Prairie, Alberta to see this when I was 12 years old, and [it's a movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114388/) that I have seen a million times, and will see it a gazillion more."

## _Stories We Tell_ - Sarah Polley

"[This documentary](https://www.nfb.ca/film/stories_we_tell/) is one of the most beautiful, personal, surprising feats of filmmaking I’ve ever experienced.  Growing up with Sarah Polley on “Road to Avonlea”, I have been a lifelong fan of her work.  This is next-level art of the first order.

## _We're Here_ - Bob the Drag Queen, Eureka O'Hara and Shangela

"This documentary series has become appointment viewing in quarantine.  I’m hunkered down with my composer-collaborator Missy Mazzoli in Briarcliff Manor, NY, and this documentary series where three drag queens travel to small towns in the US to stage one-night-only spectacular shows with the locals is as joyous, moving and addictive as television comes."

The Young Pope / The New Pope

            Paolo Sorrentino

·      The two seasons of Paola Sorrentino’s papal extravaganza is television at its most arresting and cinematic.  Every shot is an image you want to luxuriate in.  And being a sucker for sensational performances, I find the work of Jude Law, Sally Field, Scott Shepherd, John Malkovitch and Silvio Orlando is some of the best you’ll find anywhere.
