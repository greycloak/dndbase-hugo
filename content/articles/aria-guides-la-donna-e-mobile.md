1. When music is written in 3/8 time, it nearly always has a big feeling of one beat to the bar. Keep that in mind throughout this aria, because it will keep you looking at the big picture. (Hint: the first sentence actually continues all the way to #2 below.) Let the first bar feel like a pickup to the next bar, and so on - and when you sing that fun little portamento on "è mobile", let it shoot you forward to the next downbeat. With all the square, simple phrasing, contrast will be key to keeping this interesting: Verdi starts you with _con brio_ (and hopefully, legato), then asks for crisper text at "qual piùma", then explicit legato at "muta d'accento", then with some virility at "Sempre un amabile". The many faces of an insufferable Duke.
2. This bit is tricky because you have to balance the short note value on "mo-bil", with actually singing it. In the practice room, take out the rest and get used to how this phrase feels; then add in the rest gently, taking care not to keep "mo-" spinning, even if it's short.
