## The Drunken Tenor, via Seattle Opera

If you've not had the chance to see tenor Robert McPherson's "tipsy persona" live, you can tune in to catch him from home this weekend. On **June 26, 7pm PDT**, Seattle Opera's virtual opera offerings will feature the premiere online performance of [The Drunken Tenor](https://thedrunkentenor.com/). McPherson is joined by pianist David McDade and soprano Jennifer Bromagen for a program that balances Verdi and Bizet with the comedic joys of Zoom concerts and microphone management.

The event can be streamed on Seattle Opera's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SeattleOpera) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SeattleOpera) channels, or via their [website](http://seattleopera.org/). For a sneak peek, check out the trailer:
