1. Usually, music written in 3/8 time has a feeling of one-beat-to-the-bar - but in this aria, it's a bit murky. There's certainly a feeling of one, but it's quite broad, almost like the beats are held back, like a dance that's a bit "off". And I think for a singer whose voice suits the role of Azucena, creating some space for all these dotted figures is wise. So, choose a tempo where you won't trip over the trills and dots, then find your big, swinging one-to-the-bar.

2. Part of these accents, like the one on "Urli", is to remind you to lighten up after the long note, so the dotted figures come out more clearly. While you lighten up, keep spinning the \[u\] vowel right through to the tied eighth note, otherwise you'll end up flat on the D on "-li". The same applies for "intorno" in the next phrase.

3. Really treat the "la" as a pickup to "tetra", so your accented E's come out more dramatically. Use the crescendo/diminuendo that Verdi gives you on "fiamma", and imagine a tiny portamento from the E to the F. Work with your teacher on that double \[m\], it can be a tricky detail to include. Leading up to the trill on "ciel", plan where you're taking serious breaths, and where you're sipping. I'd advise only a sip before the second "che s'alza", so your serious breath is better for "al ciel". A note on trilling: see thy teacher.
