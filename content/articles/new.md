So, readers: How the &$%# are you?

Are you finding a quarantine groove, yet? I imagine plenty of you are now deft at making bread, ordering groceries online, and remembering to keep a mask handy. You probably have a now-acute sense of what six-feet-apart looks like. You're probably a little Zoomed out.

I know it's not a barrel of fun or anything, but I do hope that the above resonates with you, readers. Because it's also likely that you're out there panicking. Maybe you've got a fever, or a dry cough, or some other symptom that makes your stomach drop. You might be missing family something fierce, because you're making that brutal decision between seeing your loved ones and taking needless risks. Or you might be in a fight with someone you love who's being reckless.

Or - and this one hurts, my artsy freelancer types - you might be at a career stand-still. I hope you're in a position where you're not looking seriously at homelessness (I'm not trying to be trite, it's what's happening out there), and I hope you have a place to go if Plan A isn't working out. And even if you're staying financially afloat, I'm still thinking of you, readers - because it's fucking hard to stay motivated about working in the performing arts in times like these.

Sometimes I talk to and about performing artists - singers, really - like I'm included in their bubble. I'm not, actually. I used to be really emotionally invested, though; in my days as a voice coach and répétiteur, the motivation and achievement of the singers I worked with was something that gave me energy and inspiration. Hearing you guys get applause, after seeing how effing hard you worked, gave me such pride and admiration. And when something happened that wasn't right - some catty critic wrote garbage about you, a director was a bitch to you, someone made you feel like you and your voice weren't enough - I jumped to your defence. _Fuck that critic; I'll start my own goddamn opera blog_.
