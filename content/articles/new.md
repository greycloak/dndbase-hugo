So, readers: How the &$%# are you?

Are you finding a quarantine groove, yet? I imagine plenty of you are now deft at making bread, ordering groceries online, and remembering to keep a mask handy. You probably have a now-acute sense of what six-feet-apart looks like. You're probably a little Zoomed out. 

I know it's not a barrel of fun or anything, but I do hope that the above resonates with you, readers. Because it's also likely that you're out there panicking. Maybe you've got a fever, or a dry cough, or some other symptom that makes your stomach drop. You might be missing family something fierce, because you're making that brutal decision between seeing your loved ones and taking needless risks. Or you might be in a fight with someone you love who's being reckless.

Or - and this one hurts, my artsy freelancer types - you might be at a career stand-still. I hope you're in a position where you're not looking seriously at homelessness (I'm not trying to be trite, it's what's happening out there), and I hope you have a place to go if Plan A isn't working out.
