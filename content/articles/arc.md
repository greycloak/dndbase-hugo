I'll come out and admit that often, when opera singers put out studio recordings, I don't get excited about it. Sometimes the album title takes itself too seriously, some ponderous snippet of Yeats or Rückert standing as a bit of proverb or twee metaphor. Sometimes the opera singer's recording feels too precious, too close to the microphone, too far away from the honest, full-throated way they sing live.

But I adored _Only an Octave Apart_, the recently-released collaboration between star countertenor [Anthony Roth Costanzo](/scene/people/anthony-roth-costanzo/) and actor/cabaret singer [Justin Vivian Bond](https://www.justinvivianbond.com/). It's essentially an album of duets, fusing operatic arias and pop songs in properly ingenious arrangements — many of which were done by _au courant_ composer Nico Muhly.

First thing's first: Costanzo sounds his best yet. He sings full-out with a tone that seems new, the latest colour of an ever-changing voice. Here, Costanzo has a smooth, enameled sound, confident in his technique but with a refreshing sense of ease. When he croons into the microphone it's a choice, not an unwanted ASMR experience.

And Bond, of Broadway, off-Broadway, _Short Bus_ and _The Get Down_ fame, is a fantastic foil to Costanzo. Together, they really do sing an octave apart, and instead of it cuing an eye roll, it lands like lovable camp. Bond's throaty sound is equal parts Elvis Costello, David Bowie, and Rufus Wainwright, and they have that off-the-cuff way of half-singing that's so utterly cabaret.

Musically, _Only an Octave Apart_ has no business being so clever. The aria/song mash-ups are the product of a lot of thought and respect for the original works, but they're also so much fun. 

"Egyptian Sun" blends "Walk Like an Egyptian" with Phillip Glass' "Hymn to the Sun", a cool fusion of styles and a pointed nod to Costanzo's signature work in Glass' _Akhnaten_.

There's an awesome mix of Gluck's "Deh Placatevi con me" from _Orfeo ed Euridice_ (another bit of Costanzo branding) with Peter Gabriel's "Don't Give Up", which is adorable in the thematic through-line. 

And I laughed at the fun of pairing Dido's Lament with "White Flag" by...wait for it...Dido. 

I think what

rooted in history/technique/respect for our ancestors, but using the medium to say something really modern (or at least saying it in a modern context, since this argument over gender is actually really old)

JVB: Broadway, Off-Broadway, West End, _Short Bus_, _The Get Down_

* 
* something immediately gripping about ARC's first note, it's bold but sof, enameled on the sides, perfect but not robotic, crazy
* Justin Vivian Bond joins soon, hugely different, a bit fragile/brittle but likable and at arm's reach - acts as translator
* JVB sound: a bit Elvis Costello, a bit David Bowie, a bit Rufus Wainwright
* really are singing an octave apart, trading phrases and languages, JVB uses chest voice, both have an easy vibrato that sounds like old Hollywood
* search for the doppelgnger, "to make our solitude less thorned"
* they nod to Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews at Carnegie Hall in 1962, where Andrews had the "hygienic" confidence and Burnett had the comedy
* "Listening, we forget which voice is higher and which is lower, which is silken and which is stringent, which is delicate and which is rugged, which is soigné and which is crenellated, which is overtly seductive and which is secretly a cocktail, which frequents the bar and which requires the barre, which genuflects to disco and which has an appetite for mordents." - Program notes by Wayne Koestenbaum
* Egyptian Sun: "Walk like an Egyptian" mushed with Glass' Hymn to the Sun
* this album is so exciting! it's rooted in the pop culture of the last time we might have successfully melded opera singers with the rest of society, comes from a golden age, really, the time Andrews/Burnett were on TV, Marilyn Horne on Carsen, Beverly Sills, eg.
* and it's well done - ARC really does sound great, we don't feel ASMR'd or like he's crooning (unless he means to)
* **arrangements by Nico Muhly, very very cool**
* Gluck/Gabriel
* really exciting sound for ARC with the Gabriel, next to JVB he runs with the "feminine" counterpart
* Purcell-Garden mash-up, nod to this guy:

Faeries at the Bottom of my Garden:

* spoken word, very Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, very Dame Edna
* ARC's When I Am Laid is really arrestingly beautiful
* Dido-Dido...get it?? It's pretty great. JVB sounds smooth and easy - and take any chance you can to throw in a Ridi Pagliacci break
* it's one of the albums where you keep saying, no I think _this_ is my favourite track
* Rainbows/Raindrop
