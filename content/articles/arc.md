* something immediately gripping about ARC's first note, it's bold but sof, enameled on the sides, perfect but not robotic, crazy
* Justin Vivian Bond joins soon, hugely different, a bit fragile/brittle but likable and at arm's reach - acts as translator
* JVB sound: a bit Elvis Costello, a bit David Bowie, a bit Rufus Wainwright
* really are singing an octave apart, trading phrases and languages, JVB uses chest voice, both have an easy vibrato that sounds like old Hollywood
* search for the doppelgnger, "to make our solitude less thorned"
* they nod to Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews at Carnegie Hall in 1962, where Andrews had the "hygienic" confidence and Burnett had the comedy
* "Listening, we forget which voice is higher and which is lower, which is silken and which is stringent, which is delicate and which is rugged, which is soign√© and which is crenellated, which is overtly seductive and which is secretly a cocktail, which frequents the bar and which requires the barre, which genuflects to disco and which has an appetite for mordents." - Program notes by Wayne Koestenbaum
* Egyptian Sun: "Walk like an Egyptian" mushed with Glass' Hymn to the Sun
* this album is so exciting! it's rooted in the pop culture of the last time we might have successfully melded opera singers with the rest of society, comes from a golden age, really, the time Andrews/Burnett were on TV, Marilyn Horne on Carsen, Beverly Sills, eg.
* and it's well done - ARC really does sound great, we don't feel ASMR'd or like he's crooning (unless he means to)
* **arrangements by Nico Muhly, very very cool**
* Gluck/Gabriel
* really exciting sound for ARC with the Gabriel, next to JVB he runs with the "feminine" counterpart
* Purcell-Garden mash-up, nod to this guy:

Faeries at the Bottom of my Garden:

* spoken word, very Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, very Dame Edna
* ARC's When I Am Laid is really arrestingly beautiful
* Dido-Dido...get it?? It's pretty great. JVB sounds smooth and easy - and take any chance you can to throw in a Ridi Pagliacci break
* it's one of the albums where you keep saying, no I think _this_ is my favourite track
* Rainbows/Raindrop
