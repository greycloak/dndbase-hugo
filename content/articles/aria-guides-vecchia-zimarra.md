* I find it so incredibly touching that Colline, the philosopher who overthinks by trade, finds such gravitas in the selling of his coat. It's not a small gesture, of course; it's cold out, and Colline is poor, so sacrificing his coat is a big deal. But I think it helps to sing this aria to a friend, not a garment. It's a bit overdone, a bit exaggerated in sentiment, but that's who Colline is; he overthinks his own facial hair, so of course he'd made a ponderous moment out of trying to help save a life. That's all to say that the stakes need to be high, here **(1)**; this is a goodbye aria to a living, generous being that just happens to resemble a coat. Oh, and when you get to the _poco rit_ at the end of the first line, make sure you sing right through the space between C-sharp and B-natural; it's easy to fall flat if you let your energy go too soon.
* A lot of basses find this tessitura tricky here **(2)**. Be specific with the two vowels in "mai", and make your life a bit easier by turning "non curvasti" into "nong curvasti"; it's easier to keep the legato with that \[Å‹\] sound. Also, be diligent and sing a good \[u\] vowel in "curvasti", even though it's a short note. And as you finally relax at the end of the phrase, think ahead and keep some height in your sound. You just have to pop right up to the high E-flat on "Passar", which is a task on the best of days.

* Enjoy this portamento on "come" **(3)**. Puccini asks for it specifically, and this is Colline's moment to remind the audience that he's more than a tenor's bearded buddy. Be exact about tempo when you get to the "filosofi e poeti" bit; the _a tempo_ is important to a conductor, so save your stretchiness for the stuff before.
