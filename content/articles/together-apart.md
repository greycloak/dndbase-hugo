* advantages of non-live - decent takes, curated recordings, b-roll video to set the mood, production shots
* Wallis and her super patterns
* Meghan Lindsay in her rural Quebec base
* Xi Yi's performance was gorgeous and well shot
* oddly enough it feels overly refined - but that's OA for you - it feels disingenuous to have them talking to each other "Thanks, Blank, so beautiful!" when it's obviously not live
* McHardy is funny, when she tosses her mask and it whacks the phone/whatever she's filming with - "I just wanna go outside"
* Juri Hiraoka dancing in her backyard, somehow so freaking Toronto
* Laird Mackintosh "Music of the Night" with crappy keyboard - almost good
* Measha kinda funny, out at an ice cream parlour parking lot because she doesn't have wifi "in the woods"
* "I don't know him from a hole in the wall, but Chris, you and I are now kindred!" nice.
* Hewitt - simple and sweet and effective Rameau - cool camera angle
