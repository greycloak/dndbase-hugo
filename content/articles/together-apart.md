The other night, I tuned into [_Together/Apart_](https://www.operaatelier.com/season-and-tickets/2020-2021-season/together-apart-opera-atelier), the virtual showcase presented by Opera Atelier. I'm not sure what I expected from this company, but I can admit to some skepticism; it's quite a pivot for any company to move from live productions to remotely curated video specials, I think it's even more drastic for OA, which has spend the last three decades producing baroque and classical opera with major nods to all things traditional (some may read: old).

* 
* 
* advantages of non-live - decent takes, curated recordings, b-roll video to set the mood, production shots
* Wallis and her super patterns
* Meghan Lindsay in her rural Quebec base
* Xi Yi's performance was gorgeous and well shot
* oddly enough it feels overly refined - but that's OA for you - it feels disingenuous to have them talking to each other "Thanks, Blank, so beautiful!" when it's obviously not live
* McHardy is funny, when she tosses her mask and it whacks the phone/whatever she's filming with - "I just wanna go outside"
* Juri Hiraoka dancing in her backyard, somehow so freaking Toronto
* Laird Mackintosh "Music of the Night" with crappy keyboard - almost good
* Measha kinda funny, out at an ice cream parlour parking lot because she doesn't have wifi "in the woods"
* "I don't know him from a hole in the wall, but Chris, you and I are now kindred!" nice.
* Hewitt - simple and sweet and effective Rameau - cool camera angle
* Ainsworth's Pygmalion is a great pick (loved him in that role) but the sound is mixed weird and you can't hear him well, shame with all that coloratura
