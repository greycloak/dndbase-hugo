I know it's a bit early to think about January 2022, but in this case, we must.

Tickets for the Royal Conservatory of Music's annual contemporary music festival, 21C, go on sale to the general public on September 10, 2021. And now that in-person concert tickets are more coveted than ever, it's important to note that this season's 21C line-up is not to be missed.

The festival runs from January 12-23, 2022, and it kicks off with the world premiere of _Gould's Wall_, the new Glenn Gould-inspired opera by Brian Current and [Liza Balkan](https://www.schmopera.com/meet-the-director-liza-balkan/).
