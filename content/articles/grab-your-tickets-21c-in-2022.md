A few items for you, readers.

In the short-term: get signed up for the Canadian Opera Company's digital membership! It gets you access to the COC's season - which so far, has unveiled a solid line-up of digital events, all free to stream.

I know it's a bit early to think about January 2022, but in this case, we must.

Tickets for the Royal Conservatory of Music's annual contemporary music festival, [21C](https://www.rcmusic.com/performance/21c-music-festival?_ga=2.20016318.706228005.1630957371-1404247250.1630957371), go on sale to the general public on September 10, 2021. And now that in-person concert tickets are more coveted than ever, it's important to note that this season's 21C line-up, running January-February 2022 is not to be missed.

It's certainly cool that the [Kronos Quartet](https://www.schmopera.com/constantly-new-the-kronos-quartet/) is doing a residency for this year's festival; they're slated for three performances, including a concert with [Glenn Gould School students](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/kronos-quartet-with-students-from-the-glenn-go-(2)), and a [live documentary](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/kronos-quartet-on-film-a-thousand-thoughts-(2)) presented in partnership with the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema. 

It's definitely cool about the Canadian premiere of Marc Neikrug's [_A Song by Mahler_](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/arc-ensemble-marc-neikrug-s-a-song-by-mahler-(2)), which centres around a celebrated soprano, her battle with Alzheimer's and the music of Gustav Mahler.

And yes, there are rich recital offerings, out of [Gerald Finley and Julius Drake](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/gerald-finley-and-julius-drake), [Morgan-Paige Melbourne](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/morgan-paige-melbourne-(2)), [Eve Egoyan](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/21c-cinq-a-sept-eve-egoyan-(3)), the [Danish String Quartet](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/danish-string-quartet), and [Ang√®le Dubeau](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/angele-dubeau-la-pieta-(3)).

But if you ask me and my opera-bias, the big draw for this season's 21C is the world premiere of _Gould's Wall_, the new opera by Brian Current and [Liza Balkan](https://www.schmopera.com/meet-the-director-liza-balkan/), produced by new-opera leaders, [Tapestry Opera](/scene/companies/tapestr-opera/). Inspired by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, the "adventurous singers" of _Gould's Wall_ are set to sing suspended in the air. Shows run January 12-16, 2022. (And if you just can't wait until September 10th to snag your ticket, become a Tapestry opera Premium Member [here](https://tapestryopera.com/membership/).)
