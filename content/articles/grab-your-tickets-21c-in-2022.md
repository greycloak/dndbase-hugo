I know it's a bit early to think about January 2022, but in this case, we must.

Tickets for the Royal Conservatory of Music's annual contemporary music festival, [21C](https://www.rcmusic.com/performance/21c-music-festival?_ga=2.20016318.706228005.1630957371-1404247250.1630957371), go on sale to the general public on September 10, 2021. And now that in-person concert tickets are more coveted than ever, it's important to note that this season's 21C line-up is not to be missed.

The festival runs from [January 12-23, 2022](https://www.rcmusic.com/performance/21c-music-festival?_ga=2.20016318.706228005.1630957371-1404247250.1630957371), and it kicks off with the world premiere of _Gould's Wall_, the new opera by Brian Current and [Liza Balkan](https://www.schmopera.com/meet-the-director-liza-balkan/), produced by new-opera leaders, [Tapestry Opera](/scene/companies/tapestr-opera/). Inspired by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, the "adventurous singers" of _Gould's Wall_ are set to sing suspended in the air. Shows run January 12-16, 2022. (And if you just can't wait until September 10th to snag your ticket, become a Tapestry opera Premium Member [here](https://tapestryopera.com/membership/).)

In recital-land, the offerings are few but rich: pianist [Morgan-Paige Melbourne](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/morgan-paige-melbourne-(2))'s solo recital on **January 16, 2022 at 1pm**; [Eve Egoyan](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/21c-cinq-a-sept-eve-egoyan-(3))'s world premiere of _Seven Studies for Augmented Piano_; and on **January 22, 2022 at 5pm**, [Gerald Finley and Julius Drake](https://www.rcmusic.com/events-and-performances/gerald-finley-and-julius-drake) offer up Schubert and Shakespeare on **January 23, 2022 at 3pm**.
