Immediately after reading Kevin Simmonds' new book, _The Monster I Am Today: Leontyne Price and a Life in Verse_, I went on a YouTube spree. Listening to Leontyne Price's Aida was all that made sense after reading this biography-in-verse, where Simmonds tells the story of how Price was the source of his love for singing. He blends poetry, prose, quotes from interviews, quotes from critics, and even fantasical FBI memos regarding Leontyne herself.

* 
* 
* poetry and prose mixed together into a specific history that still feels universal
* any music student will feel kin with Kevin's early exposure to music and the awe of a voice like Price's; choir life; a great first teacher who inspires
* Pri-chay joke, music nerds for life
* other stuff that doesn't feel familiar to me: arguments over one's Black sound, exasperation from voice teachers over Kevin's voice, which apparently needed to be reined in; being a minority in a music school; being gay and closeted; being abused by a teacher
* darkness in the voice is apparently an issue - but then there's someone like Leontyne, a dark voice, and also opera royalty. So, what's the issue?
* the idea of "wrong rep" not just being limited to vocal colour (who was the Tosca who sassed about how Price should only sing Bess?)
* excerpts from critics being patronizing and racist
* FBI surveillance of Price - great gag*
* time-stamping her ovation
* the turban, a purple gown, brand images of Leontyne
* it's nuts, the amount of poise and control and shrugging off the shit that Black people have to maintain - otherwise all is lost, they seem angry, irrational, bitter, unprofessional, immature
