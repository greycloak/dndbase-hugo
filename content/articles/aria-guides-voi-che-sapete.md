preamble = "I kind of can't believe we haven't done an Aria Guide for this bread-and-butter pick for trouser role mezzos. This aria is such a great moment in Mozart's _Le nozze di Figaro_; it's meant to be a stand-alone tune, as Cherubino is giving an impromptu recital (read: Susanna told him to) of the new song he wrote. The dramatic tension comes out of the fact that Cherubino is singing for the Countess, on whom he has a hopeless, teenage crush. \n\n\"Voi che sapete\" is about puberty, becoming girl-crazy, and involuntary bodily functions that are fun but also difficult to hide. It's one of those Mozart arias that seems simple, but demands a lot in the details. With your teacher and coach, this Aria Guide can help Cherubinos-to-be get started:"
