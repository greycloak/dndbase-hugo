Here in Canada, as the light at the end of a long pandemic tunnel starts to trickle in, the Queen's University Dan School of Drama and Music is wasting no time in celebrating the performing arts.

Running from **May 25-28, 2021**, the inaugural [Watershed Festival](https://www.watershedmusictheatre.com/) is a first-of-its-kind online showcase of opera and musical theatre - two genres that, curiously, have been historically siloed despite their clear common ground. With the recent merging of the Queen's music and drama schools, the fusion of musical theatre and opera became particularly organic in the mid-sized city of Kingston, Ontario.

"As someone who really has worked in both the opera and musical theatre fields, I’m just looking forward to having those two groups in the same room and as a part of the same conversations," says Dean Burry, Canadian composer and Watershed Festival Artistic Director. "There are strikingly still so many stereotypes about the two fields held by professionals on both sides, and the reality is that opera and musicals have so much in common, but often do things in slightly different ways.  I think there is a lot to lean from each other."

The virtual line-up for the Festival features a healthy mix of creativity. Dan School professor Julie Salverson's work kicks things off on May 25, 7pm, with a [gala book launch](https://www.watershedmusictheatre.com/galabooklaunch) of her _When Words Sing: Seven Canadian Libretti_. Salverson is joined by Tapestry Opera Artistic Director Michael Hidetoshi Mori, and acclaimed Canadian librettists George Elliott Clarke (_Beatrice Chauncy_), Ann-Marie MacDonald (_Nigredo Hotel_) and Marie Clements (_Missing_), who will present excerpts of their work.

On May 2, Montreal-based Musique 3 Femmes resents an evening of new operas by women composers and librettists, as part of the Festival's [CREATE series](https://www.watershedmusictheatre.com/musique-3-femmes).

In the [New Works Showcase](https://www.watershedmusictheatre.com/newworksshowcase), audiences can catch three in-progress musical theatre works: Jake Schindler and Sam Boer's _Ursa_, Kevin Skelton's _Pulse_, Afarino Mansouri's _Zuleyka_. Additionally, Calgary Opera's documentary _Seeds of Namwayut_ will get a screening.

On top of the performances is a series of presentations and conversations by leading figures in music theatre, including Opera Philadelphia General Director [David Devan](https://www.operaphila.org/about/our-people/leadership/david-b-devan/), Amplified Opera co-founder [Marion Newman](https://www.amplifiedopera.com/marion-newman), and renowned music critic [Anne Midgette](https://anchor.fm/tewbop/episodes/Anne-Midgette-Art-Is-Not-the-Institutions-eiur6g).

"The Watershed Festival will inaugurate a summer-long chain of festivals, including the Festival of Live Digital Art in June, the Fringe Festival in July, and the Kick and Push Festival in July and August," says Craig Walker, Director of the Dan School of Drama and Music. "Together these really help to underscore what an important cultural hub Kingston has become."

The Festival's final night features a sneak-peek premiere of _The Lancashire Lass_, the upcoming suffragette-inspired musical, written by Canadian musical theatre creator Leslie Arden and commissioned by the Dan School. "I could not possibly be more excited about showcasing selections from _The Lancashire Lass_," says Brayah Pickard, a Festival participant and creator of the role of Christabel in the new work. "Virtual music theatre is a huge undertaking, and there are so many people working to make this one something truly remarkable."

Dean: "When I first moved her three years ago, I was blown away with not only the artistic talent but also infrastructure in this relatively small city.  Of course, the university helps with that, but there is something about Kingston which in inherently “artistic”.  Not only is it the kind of place that a lot of artists like to call home, but the municipal government fund numerous initiatives to support local creators."

Dean: "I am hoping that they will take away a better definition of what “music theatre” is.  We are constantly looking for the answers to that question as well.  Good opera and good musical theatre have so much to offer and the inclusion of the many diverse voices that have traditionally been excluded from the field stands to strength it greatly. I also want Kingstonians to feel that this is a festival for them.  As I mentioned, Kingston is a phenomenally artistic city…and that includes the audiences!"

Dean: "going virtual has a number of silver linings: we’ve got people joining us from around the world, and I would imagine the best aspects of that kind of reach will always be a part of the festival moving forward."

Craig: "whereas at one point, opera was considered an art form that was quite distinct from the Broadway-style musical, increasingly, those distinctions look arbitrary and unpersuasive, and it has become obvious that the two art forms are both located on the same continuum of music theatre, and that cross-fertilization has led to many exciting new artistic innovations."

Craig: "From the time that Leslie first mentioned the idea for a musical about the suffragette movement, my excitement has been building."

Brayah Pickard (plays Christabel in Lancashire): "I could not possibly be more excited about showcasing selections from The Lancashire Lass, by Leslie Arden, on the final night of the festival. Virtual music theatre is a huge undertaking, and there are so many people working to make this one something truly remarkable."

Brayah: "If I had to put it in one sentence, I’d say “If this is what we can accomplish in a time of global crisis and isolation, just wait until we can all get together again!”"

2022 in-person festival will have WP of _The Lancashire Lass_ at Grand Theatre
