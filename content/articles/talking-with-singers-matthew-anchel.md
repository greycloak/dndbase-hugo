* modern opera singer, great melding of personality and craft - also, diversifying, which is oddly a new thing for an opera singer
* makeup tutorials, body positivity, singing, gay best friend

Body positivity:

* men have more freedom to speak out, versus women (misogyny)

"I think when a guy does it, there's less judgement about it, which is so messed up."

"I really try not to be insulting."

\-Angry Fat People with Tracy Cox

"I try to be like, as sympathetic as possible, so that someone who might be triggered by some of the things that I'm talking about can actually just listen and not just instantly turn off."

* companies haven't pointed to a problem with his SM content
* "they asked me to tone down my myself. like they've asked me to be less gay or to not wear makeup or advise me to just sort of be more masculine in my life."

"I think on Tik Tok 95% of my followers are women, which is crazy when you think that's like probably 700,000 or so people, you know, like, and so women in my life have always supported me. And I think the women that follow me, a lot of them are people who are want a connection, like a friendship connection, and I feel like I'm there for them."

"I know that there's like a lot of baggage with the term gay best friend general. There's like a lot of tokenized is would it be token, like a token gay and like, all this stuff? And I don't want to promote that kind of stuff, even though I mean it in the nicest possible way. And sort of owning that because because like, that's sort of my persona on tik tok, I guess. But But yeah, like a, like, gay best friend that everyone needs in their life."

Body image in opera industry

"So what I think happens a lot is that you have people who are like maybe more stereotypically attractive in thin bodies, who maybe have medium voices, the not the best voices in the world. But they're given all this confidence, and they're promoted. And like they get opportunities, and they get to work with the best people. So they get really good at singing, even though maybe their voice isn't that amazing. So and then you have fat singers, who maybe have these unbelievable voices, and never get better at singing, because they're not given the opportunities that the thin person was given to improve, and then become, you know, this amazing artist."

"So if you're not getting those opportunities, you're not going to improve. And then at some point, it's like, well, who cares if you have a world class voice that you can't get through the roles that you're supposed to sing because you never had the opportunities to learn? You know?"
