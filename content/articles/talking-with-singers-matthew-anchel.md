By anyone's account, American bass Matthew Anchel is having a stellar 2021-22. He's settling in for a New York-based season, a string of contracts with The Metropolitan Opera that include covering in [_Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/die-meistersinger-von-nurnberg/) and [_Don Carlos_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/don-carlos/), and making his mainstage debut in Laurent Pelly's production of [_Cendrillon_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/cinderella/), sharing the stage with Isabel Leonard, Emily D'Angelo, and Stephanie Blythe.

"I love working at the Met so much," Anchel says. He acknowledges the more unsavory news stories about the Met, "But I have only ever been treated with professionalism and respect whenever I work there."

This season will be Anchel's Met debut, but not his first season spent at the company. Since 2013, he has covered bass roles in _Die Zauberflöte_, _The Exterminating Angel_, and _Der Rosenkavalier_. He even sang in the the Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus at age 6.

\**But for all his pedigree and skill, Anchel is one of the more diverse, self-aware opera singers I've ever met**

\--

MET

"They have this enormous proscenium stage."

"It is both amazing and limiting to have that kind of space"

MET contrasts small works

"In my opinion, that's not real opera. I think it's a new version of opera, which is very interesting and can really connect with audiences. But I think it's important that if we're going to keep doing this art form, there are institutions that do opera the way it was meant to be done. Because otherwise, what is it? It's weird musical theatre."

\--

Diversity in opera

opera is all about donors

"Knowing that that's the main issue is that, I mean, it'll be interesting to see what happens with donors and boards of companies to see if they become more diverse, or a younger generation comes in and they have different wants and interests."

"The one nice thing about mainstream entertainment is that it's all about the audience, and who was going to buy tickets and who can we get interested in? So even if it's like pandering to us, I mean, it works. Because it's the business. It's a bit like you're looking for the approval and the money of the masses, and not the few."

Singing craft

* both parents were opera singers
* sang in Met kids chorus at age 6
* loves cabaret
* wanted money, fame, applause when he was younger

"For me, it's more about self-expression, and showing this extension of myself."

"when you're doing it, well, it feels good. It's like addictive, it's like, you love the vibration in your body. You love like the release of it, it's like, it's, it's really this most the most amazing feeling if you learn how to sing with ease."

"it's sort of this idea of like, I feel like I'm in this like, barrel of sound, but there's this like, tiny little bird on the barrel. So, which is the bright part of my voice? So I have my little bird, it's like my words,"

"it's the idea is that we're sort of almost unnaturally carrying up our chest voice higher than it wants to go. So and that opera is training your voice to do something that's actually pretty unnatural"

"We don't make those kind of loud noises naturally, we have to train our voices to do it."

"it's the most honest version of your voice because it's like, it's it's getting rid of like any of the effects"

"always try and bring like two ideas onstage with me so because I'm, because I teach them too much of an overthinker. So like, like for a while my thing was think dark and forward for whatever reason that was working for me because the darkness kept me from spreading. And the forward it wasn't that I was singing in my nose. It was that the foreword energy of like, of like, say the words go, don't don't be in your head don't place don't like try and create a sound."

Belting

"I would say the most important thing is to realize that belting shouldn't be loud because it's, it's singing designed to be done with a microphone."

"Dark and bright, released and held, open and closed, and deep and high. I think when a singer finds the balance of all those things, it's really exciting."

"I think for opera singing in particular, it's having all of the different extremes in your voice, and then feeling it in your body so intensely."

names Maria Guleghina

"When someone does have a big voice, you feel it literally vibrating."

\--

Anchel's schedule isn't just a glimpse of good news after a long, dark pandemic - it's a classic checkpoint for any xxx-year-old bass. Basses are among the voice types that often have to wield a good amount of professional patience, waiting for the physiology of the voice to mature enough to sing the roles that best show them off.

Classic, sure — but Anchel is no tired trope about the opera careers of days gone by. Just ask the 16,000 people who follow him on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matthewanchel/), or better yet, his 831,000 followers on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@matthewanchel?). His posts range from [miniature singing lessons](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CSZ-3WtHtg0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to [makeup tips](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQrCBy2HS6V/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to all the advice one could ever want from a ["TikTok Gay Best Friend"](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CRg-9FZHSMb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). But the source of it all — be it Anchel's impressive social media presence, or his first-rate singing — lies in body positivity.

"I really try not to be insulting," Anchel laughs, pointing out the irony of his YouTube series, [_Angry Fat People_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkK1yfGGja4), which he started in 2018 with his friend and fellow singer, Tracy Cox. "I try to be as sympathetic as possible, so that someone who might be triggered by some of the things that I'm talking about can actually just listen and not just instantly turn off."

Within the opera world, the tenet of _prima la voce_ comes up against the same problem that has, until extremely recently, plagued the more mainstream performing arts: only thin bodies can be used to tell stories. And as a devourer of his content myself, I can say that Anchel's take on body positivity is equal parts awesome-bear-hug and thought-provoking-lightbulb-moment.

"What I think happens a lot, is that you have people who are maybe more stereotypically attractive in thin bodies, who maybe have medium voices —not the best voices in the world." These singers are well promoted, Anchel says, and they get opportunities to work with opera's best. "So they get really good at singing, even though maybe their voice isn't that amazing."

"Then, you have fat singers, who maybe have these unbelievable voices, and never get better at singing, because they're not given the opportunities that the thin person was given to improve, and then become, you know, this amazing artist."

It's a facet of another big, ongoing conversation in opera, about privilege.

Bucket list roles

"During the pandemic, I did Zoom readings of all the things I ever wanted to do."

* Blanche in Streetcar, Eleanor of Acquitaine in Lyingi n Winter, Tracy in Philadelphia Story, Cleopatra in Caesar and Cleopatra
* "What I learned, too, is playing roles like that is really hard."
* "I was so exhausted by the end of that reading."
* "Dream roles now, which is so silly, would be to play a deliciously campy villain on a sci-fi show. I just think that would be the most fun thing ever."

\--

* modern opera singer, great melding of personality and craft - also, diversifying, which is oddly a new thing for an opera singer
* makeup tutorials, body positivity, singing, gay best friend

Body positivity:

* men have more freedom to speak out, versus women (misogyny)

"I think when a guy does it, there's less judgement about it, which is so messed up."

"I really try not to be insulting."

\-[Angry Fat People](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgPkiQXwtjVZ2GIVOTZkx0g) with Tracy Cox

"I try to be like, as sympathetic as possible, so that someone who might be triggered by some of the things that I'm talking about can actually just listen and not just instantly turn off."

* companies haven't pointed to a problem with his SM content
* "they asked me to tone down my myself. like they've asked me to be less gay or to not wear makeup or advise me to just sort of be more masculine in my life."

"I think on Tik Tok 95% of my followers are women, which is crazy when you think that's like probably 700,000 or so people, you know, like, and so women in my life have always supported me. And I think the women that follow me, a lot of them are people who are want a connection, like a friendship connection, and I feel like I'm there for them."

"I know that there's like a lot of baggage with the term gay best friend general. There's like a lot of tokenized is would it be token, like a token gay and like, all this stuff? And I don't want to promote that kind of stuff, even though I mean it in the nicest possible way. And sort of owning that because because like, that's sort of my persona on tik tok, I guess. But But yeah, like a, like, gay best friend that everyone needs in their life."

Body image in opera industry

"So if you're not getting those opportunities, you're not going to improve. And then at some point, it's like, well, who cares if you have a world class voice that you can't get through the roles that you're supposed to sing because you never had the opportunities to learn? You know?"

"I think there are some singers who are in larger bodies who actually don't have that voice and shit. But they're told that like, that's all they can do. So that's that's also a problem as well."
