* modern opera singer, great melding of personality and craft - also, diversifying, which is oddly a new thing for an opera singer
* makeup tutorials, body positivity, singing, gay best friend

Body positivity:

* men have more freedom to speak out, versus women (misogyny)

"I think when a guy does it, there's less judgement about it, which is so messed up."

"I really try not to be insulting."

\-Angry Fat People with Tracy Cox

"I try to be like, as sympathetic as possible, so that someone who might be triggered by some of the things that I'm talking about can actually just listen and not just instantly turn off."

* companies haven't pointed to a problem with his SM content
* "they asked me to tone down my myself. like they've asked me to be less gay or to not wear makeup or advise me to just sort of be more masculine in my life."

"I think on Tik Tok 95% of my followers are women, which is crazy when you think that's like probably 700,000 or so people, you know, like, and so women in my life have always supported me. And I think the women that follow me, a lot of them are people who are want a connection, like a friendship connection, and I feel like I'm there for them."

"I know that there's like a lot of baggage with the term gay best friend general. There's like a lot of tokenized is would it be token, like a token gay and like, all this stuff? And I don't want to promote that kind of stuff, even though I mean it in the nicest possible way. And sort of owning that because because like, that's sort of my persona on tik tok, I guess. But But yeah, like a, like, gay best friend that everyone needs in their life."

Body image in opera industry

"So what I think happens a lot is that you have people who are like maybe more stereotypically attractive in thin bodies, who maybe have medium voices, the not the best voices in the world. But they're given all this confidence, and they're promoted. And like they get opportunities, and they get to work with the best people. So they get really good at singing, even though maybe their voice isn't that amazing. So and then you have fat singers, who maybe have these unbelievable voices, and never get better at singing, because they're not given the opportunities that the thin person was given to improve, and then become, you know, this amazing artist."

"So if you're not getting those opportunities, you're not going to improve. And then at some point, it's like, well, who cares if you have a world class voice that you can't get through the roles that you're supposed to sing because you never had the opportunities to learn? You know?"

"I think there are some singers who are in larger bodies who actually don't have that voice and shit. But they're told that like, that's all they can do. So that's that's also a problem as well."

Diversity in opera

* opera is all about donors

"Knowing that that's the main issue is that, I mean, it'll be interesting to see what happens with donors and boards of companies to see if they become more diverse, or a younger generation comes in and they have different wants and interests."

"The one nice thing about mainstream entertainment is that it's all about the audience, and who was going to buy tickets and who can we get interested in? So even if it's like pandering to us, I mean, it works. Because it's the business. It's a bit like you're looking for the approval and the money of the masses, and not the few."

Singing craft

"when you're doing it, well, it feels good. It's like addictive, it's like, you love the vibration in your body. You love like the release of it, it's like, it's, it's really this most the most amazing feeling if you learn how to sing with ease."

"it's sort of this idea of like, I feel like I'm in this like, barrel of sound, but there's this like, tiny little bird on the barrel. So, which is the bright part of my voice? So I have my little bird, it's like my words,"

"it's the idea is that we're sort of almost unnaturally carrying up our chest voice higher than it wants to go. So and that opera is training your voice to do something that's actually pretty unnatural"

"We don't make those kind of loud noises naturally, we have to train our voices to do it."

"it's the most honest version of your voice because it's like, it's it's getting rid of like any of the effects"

"always try and bring like two ideas onstage with me so because I'm, because I teach them too much of an overthinker. So like, like for a while my thing was think dark and forward for whatever reason that was working for me because the darkness kept me from spreading. And the forward it wasn't that I was singing in my nose. It was that the foreword energy of like, of like, say the words go, don't don't be in your head don't place don't like try and create a sound."

Belting

"I would say the most important thing is to realize that belting shouldn't be loud because it's, it's singing designed to be done with a microphone."

MET

"I love working at the Met so much. I know that like, you know, sometimes, like we hear about things, there have been a lot of things coming out in the news about about things happening there. But I have only ever been treated with professionalism and respect whenever I work there."

"one of the most impressive people in rehearsals to me was Alina garantia. I just thought she was so focused."

"she was nice to everybody, but also very, but also very introverted, in a way, but like, just so professional. And never any drama, just like would try anything you asked her to do."

"And there was one day where we were all there. And it was the all of us. Everyone was there. The covers all small parts everybody. And bass, we're seeing the trio. And Renee really showed off in that rehearsal. And it was really unbelievable."
