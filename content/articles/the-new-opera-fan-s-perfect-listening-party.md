Readers, a quick heads up about something very cool happening Wednesday night!

On February 9 at 7:30pm ET, join [PROTOTYPE](https://prototypefestival.org/)'s listening party, featuring the soon-to-be-released album by David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, _Am I Born_. The work is set to come out February 11 (and you can certainly purchase your digital copy here), featuring music director Julian Wachner and soprano Mellissa Hughes.

And just to make sure you all know why I'm excited about this: 

* PROTOTYPE = Beth Morrison Projects, as in the folks behind [_Angel's Bone_](/angels-bone-i-finally-saw-it-and-im-never-going-to-be-the-same/), [_The Aging Magician_](/magic-everywhere-in-sdos-aging-magician/), and _p r i s m._
* The dynamic duo of David T. Little and Royce Vavrek are probably best known for their acclaimed 2012 collaboration, [_Dog Days_](https://bethmorrisonprojects.org/projects/touring/dog-days/).

It's a mini who's-who of the contemporary opera scene, and this free event is a must-catch. See you there, I hope!
