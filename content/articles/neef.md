Alright. This one's for the Canadians.

Alexander Neef, General Director of the Canadian Opera Company, [announced this week](https://www.coc.ca/COC-news1?EntryID=22075) that he would be starting his new job early. As of September 1, he'll be the General Director of the Paris Opera - a post he was supposed to start in 2021, after finishing his final season at the COC.

A few things led to this. First, COVID-19. So far, the COC has called off its fall programming, including the much-hyped _Parsifal_ that Neef spent about a decade putting together. (It also would have marked the first fully-staged _Parsifal_ in Canada, which would have been neat. It's postponed to 2022-23). And in all likelihood, the COC will have to postpone or cancel the rest of its season. I imagine that's a pretty shitty way for Neef to spend a final season in Toronto.

The plot thickened when current (?) Paris General Director St√©phane Lissner announced he would peace out about six months ahead of schedule. He'll be done in December 2020, probably because he doesn't want to be the head of an empty stage for his final year either. (Is it just me, or does this also feel like a totally French move? Like, "C'est la pandemie. Au revoir.")

Anyway, the the end result is that Neef will leave Toronto and take on full responsibilities at the helm of the Paris Opera _while still actually being the head of the COC_. The COC is still hunting for its next General Director - they've likely found their person, but it's not yet announced - which means that for the 2020-21 season, Canada's largest opera company will be silent and effectively without leadership.

I think this is crap. Sure, there's
