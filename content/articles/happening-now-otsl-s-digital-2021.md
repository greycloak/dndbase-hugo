Readers, I'm pretty excited about the fact that all throughout September, you can stream Opera Theatre of Saint Louis' "wildly successful and sold-out" [2021 Outdoor Festival](https://opera-stl.org/streaming)!

Marking OTSL's 46th season, [this year's Festival](https://opera-stl.org/streaming) offers up six productions to a safe-capacity crowd, including [_Gianni Schicchi_](https://opera-stl.org/gianni), [_La voix humaine_](https://opera-stl.org/voix), [_Highway 1, U.S.A._](https://opera-stl.org/highway), and three [world premieres](https://opera-stl.org/nwbv-lab). Additionally, the season features [_I Dream a World_](https://opera-stl.org/dream), OTSL's first-ever concert in honour of Juneteenth, and the annual Gerdine Young Artists showcase, [_Center Stage_](https://opera-stl.org/2021-outdoor-center-stage). Happily, the Festival has also gone digital, with the help of Once Films, and the 2021 season is available to stream in HD through September 30th. The streams are $30 each ($15 for students), or you can get a full pass for $130 ($50 for students).

I intend to take it all in, and I'm particularly excited to experience Will Liverman and Nicole Cabell in a production together. Plus, Patricia Racette's [Elle](https://opera-stl.org/voix) is an exciting thought.

â€œIt was important for us to document this exciting, albeit different season.," said OTSL General Director Andrew Jorgensen. "Our outdoor festival was a fantastic success, but we could only accommodate 25% of our usual capacity. We cannot wait to share our season with the hundreds of supporters who were unable to attend."

 Off I go (and so should you!) to take in OTSL's digital season. Full details start [right here](https://opera-stl.org/streaming).
