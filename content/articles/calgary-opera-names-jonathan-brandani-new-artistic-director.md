**Oliver Munar: Let's start by getting to know you a little better. What attracted you to the world of opera?**

**Jonathan Brandani:** I didn’t start as an opera person, I started as a piano player. Being a pianist, I had my first experiences playing for my best friends who were singers. They exposed me to the beautiful world of opera and I was fascinated and wanted to know more, and they asked me to play for rehearsals, voice lessons and performances. I didn’t even notice that I was into opera: at one point, I just realized that I love this artform and it felt so natural.

I remember playing as a repetiteur for an outdoor performance in Austria of Donizetti’s La fille du régiment: the cast was amazing, the costumes were fantastic and the whole experience felt so moving. It was at that moment where I realized I would love to continue this fantastic journey where all sorts of art meet and join forces to really create a powerful performance.

**You share a hometown with the great opera composer Giacomo Puccini (Lucca, Italy) so I have to ask: what's an opera, or perhaps a composer, that you would never get tired of programming?**

**Brandani:** I truly love Puccini but not because he’s from my hometown. He’s truly one of the greatest composers ever. There is so much humanity and feeling in his music. The vocal writing is amazing, orchestral writing is phenomenal, and he really wants to talk to the hearts of people: to tell beautiful stories in a compelling way.

**Do you have a favourite Puccini opera?**

**Brandani:** I really love _La fanciulla del West_. Compared to _Tosca_ or _La bohème_ it is not performed nearly as often, but it represents a great mix of symphonic writing, a very powerful story of redemption through love, and it’s one of the few operas that doesn’t end with a dead person on stage - it’s a happier ending and I really love it.

There’s so much tragedy in opera already and _La fanciulla_ is a serious and profound opera, but it really shows the power of love and how you, as an individual, can influence other people’s lives and create redemption. It gives a big message of hope that yes, we can shape the world for the better and yes, our actions can really create a better environment for everybody.

**Because _La fanciulla_ is not performed nearly as often as _La bohème_ and _Tosca_, can we perhaps assume or anticipate that _La fanciulla_ may make its way to Calgary Opera in the near future?**

**Brandani:** It’s too early to say, but there are so many things to take care of right away, but definitely it’s on my radar.

**What attracted you to this post with Calgary Opera, and to the city of Calgary in general?**

**Brandani:** I was in Calgary in the Fall of 2019 to conduct La bohème with Calgary Opera. I was there with my wife and two young boys and we loved our time there. We loved the city, we loved the surrounding area, and we loved the people. I thought the company and I had a nice chemistry: very friendly and collaborative. I really felt a human connection, not just an artistic one, and I remember very clearly that I would love to come back.

When I heard about the position being available, I thought why not give it a try? I had my heart filled with very good memories.
