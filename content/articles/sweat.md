Thursday saw the Toronto premiere of Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, _Sweat_. It's a thoroughly American story, inspired and researched in the world of unionized factory workers who had been squeezed, pressured, and literally locked out of their workplace as the new millennium arrived and corporate greed spread its tendrils, noticeably unchecked.

Nottage makes a microcosm of Reading, Pennsylvania, which in 2011 was the poorest city of its size in all of the US; before that, it was a factory town, where people had one job to carry them from high school graduation to (hopefully) retirement and a generous pension. The playwright spoke with workers from the steel factory in Reading, who were 93 weeks into a lockout, essentially forced out of their jobs and watching their retirement plan - the whole plan, really - go up in a puff of smoke.

"Their stories broke my heart and invited me to see the world from another's perspective; to be moved by people who I would not ordinarily encounter," writes Nottage of _Sweat_. "As a Black woman from Brooklyn I hadn't expected that I would be so profoundly moved by their predicament."

There is something acutely ironic about a play that tells this story. _Sweat_
