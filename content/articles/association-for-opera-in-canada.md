Hi, readers!

A quick heads-up about something very cool out of the Association for Opera in Canada:

The second iteration of the RBC Artist Fellowship has been announced, with an aim to give voice and professional experience to Canadian artists in their early careers. Applications for this year's Fellowship are due **October 4, 2021**; you can find the forms in [English](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzRnsXTgQRGVKT4byu-JZJCO-Coxk_77wAKSM8hbWrhfl8eA/viewform) and [French](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0nL0rk-aYXAm--K3JKiYRfhQqTH5Or7EHEoaeEneX75qAxw/viewform).

The Fellowship will go to "exceptional" Canadians in the opera realm: singers, directors, conductors, pianists, designers, and administrators. Recipients will get private mentorship, professional development training sessions and workshops, and networking boosts.
