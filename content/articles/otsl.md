These days, small wins are worth a lot — and I count it as a small win that I can watch Opera Theatre of St. Louis's 2021 Outdoor Festival from way up here in Canada.

The Festival, which includes six performance events from OTSL's 2021 season, is [available to stream](https://opera-stl.org/streaming) through September 30, and I'm officially recommending it. It's a great mix of standards (_Gianni Schicchi_), near-standards (_La voix humaine_), rarities (_Highway 1, U.S.A._), and world premieres ([_New Works, Bold Voices Lab_](https://opera-stl.org/nwbv-lab)).

If I'm to pick a favourite, I'm torn between the three actually fantastic new operas in the _New Works_ showcase, and the 1940s gem by William Grant Still, [_Highway 1, U.S.A._](https://opera-stl.org/highway) Both productions fit perfectly with OTSL's mission to champion new works and be a part of opera's future; I love when a great cause comes with great discoveries, too.

_Highway 1, U.S.A._ draws us in with its excellent cast, headlined by baritone [Will Liverman](/spotlight-on-will-liverman/) and soprano [Nicole Cabell](/talking-with-singers-nicole-cabell/). Right away I was pulled into the story, which as far as opera plots go, starts off fairly conflict-free; usually when I'm pulled in, it's because of the artists. Liverman and Cabell show a natural warmth for each other as Bob and Mary; they play a married couple who love and respect each other, and Mary shows her love by setting high standards for Bob and his troubled brother, Nate (Christian Mark Gibbs).

Still's score is gorgeous, a mix of luscious sounds and matter-of-fact text setting. Liverman shines in his heroic top range, delivering crisp English text that sounds easy; Cabell shows a thousand colours with her voice, joking and pleading and loving with her soprano. And interestingly, there's a clear distinction between Liverman's baritone and Christian Mark Gibbs as Nate.

The production by Ron Himes works for me. It's a fantastic show of 60s fashion, with great hats and fun florals and bright shoes. And really, who doesn't love gazing over every detail of a busy kitchen, filled with wallpaper and cafe curtains? Just like Still's score, Himes stays out of the way of this story, letting it tumble forward with natural ease.

This piece sits beautifully in the American operatic canon. It nods to its time, with the music leaning toward the sounds of Richard Rogers and George Gershwin, but boasts some fantastic ensemble singing and an earthy approach to musical storytelling. I'm so thrilled that OTSL put this up. It should go elsewhere, quickly.

Among the more standard fare are Puccini's only comedy, [_Gianni Schicchi_](https://opera-stl.org/gianni), and Poulenc's now-ubiquitous one-woman-opera, [_La voix humaine_](https://opera-stl.org/voix). The _Schicchi_ is everything you want in that show: excellent ensemble work and busy comedic scenes that border on campy, and show-stopping singing. 

Schicchi

* everything you want in a Schicchi, great ensemble work, busy scenes, characters who become your secret favourites by the end of the show
* great singing, particularly out of Rinuccio and Lauretta - he's definitely one to watch, brings warmth and realness to the story
* hokey gags but we love them
* 

Voix humaine

* English translation is clunky, but Racette handles it well, i don’t need titles
* Elle is bilingual, we imagine her French lover, her recent ensconcement in French culture, as his lover
* Set in the time, full luxury and all, ornate phone handset, flowery mantel above fireplace, vanity, chaise lounges, velvet and shades of grey/blue/periwinkle
* For some reason, this setting makes Elle less forgivable, her plight is less tragic - she’s rich, after all - maybe more frustrating, because she seems to have a lot in life, and right now it’s all boiling down to this one relationship
* This is a solid, definitive, even, version of Voix humane - it doesn’t try to connect it to today in any clear way (link to Isaiah’s), but the timeless themes come out loud

Highway 1

* Cabell - sounds fantastic, not always clear in text
* Will - great actor, engaging even when not singing
* Cool opera, nice mix of luscious music and matter-of-fact text delivery
* They have a natural warmth, love and respect for each other, she setting high standards for him
* Will sounds really fantastic, gorgeous top, an easy middle and really clear text
* Fantastic wallpaper, adorable cafe curtains, who doesn’t love staring at a stage kitchen?
* Excellent floral prints, great hats, I’m loving the style details in everyone’s purchase, earrings
* Tight, gorgeous ensemble singing in first scene
* Curious to be so drawn in to an opera that starts so conflict-free
* Gibbs is really solid, sets himself apart as a character with his voice, not easy to do with two baritones in an opera
* weird ending, again a bit conflict-free for opera
* this piece sits beautifully in the American canon, sharing space with musical theatre but definitely an opera - tells a sort of mundane story, a bit of violence, a low-key villain and a family's practical way of handling things

New Works

* On the Edge: single mom at home with three kids during pandemic, virtual learning, chaotic, noisy, oh man I feel for her
* pretty awesome vocal demands, soprano heights and jazzy chest voice
* when chaos exhausts itself, it gathers together into gorgeous ensemble singing with the whole family, reminding ourselves that we're all trying to hold together and we all miss our lives, and we're a family unit goddammit
* Moon Tea: awesome fantastical history, blending Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and the Apollo 11 astronauts, all meeting before the 1969 moon landing
* costumes! 60s fashion show
* muddy text, not always clear what everyone's saying
* The Tongue & The Lash: about a fascinating historical moment in Black/American history, from a [debate in 1965](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/james-baldwin-william-f-buckley-debate/602695/) between James Baldwin and William F. Beckley, arguing the motion, "Is the American dream at the expense of the American Negro?"
* Some of the best singing of the night, from Markel Reed (straight tone tendency I don't love, but a solid instrument), and particularly from Jonathan Johnson
* fantastic transition into blues for Baldwin's retort, nod to reality of a culture that is in the USA, undeniable and unique, like a big pressing of a point
* Johnson's tenor is striking and impressive, feels relentless and colonialistic in this context, really interesting use of Western European operatic sound
