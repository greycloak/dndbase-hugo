Schicchi

* everything you want in a Schicchi, great ensemble work, busy scenes, characters who become your secret favourites by the end of the show
* great singing, particularly out of Rinuccio and Lauretta - he's definitely one to watch, brings warmth and realness to the story
* hokey gags but we love them
* 

Voix humaine

* English translation is clunky, but Racette handles it well, i don’t need titles
* Elle is bilingual, we imagine her French lover, her recent ensconcement in French culture, as his lover
* Set in the time, full luxury and all, ornate phone handset, flowery mantel above fireplace, vanity, chaise lounges, velvet and shades of grey/blue/periwinkle
* For some reason, this setting makes Elle less forgivable, her plight is less tragic - she’s rich, after all - maybe more frustrating, because she seems to have a lot in life, and right now it’s all boiling down to this one relationship
* This is a solid, definitive, even, version of Voix humane - it doesn’t try to connect it to today in any clear way (link to Isaiah’s), but the timeless themes come out loud

Highway 1

* Cabell - sounds fantastic, not always clear in text
* Will - great actor, engaging even when not singing
* Cool opera, nice mix of luscious music and matter-of-fact text delivery
* They have a natural warmth, love and respect for each other, she setting high standards for him
* Will sounds really fantastic, gorgeous top, an easy middle and really clear text
* Fantastic wallpaper, adorable cafe curtains, who doesn’t love staring at a stage kitchen?
* Excellent floral prints, great hats, I’m loving the style details in everyone’s purchase, earrings
* Tight, gorgeous ensemble singing in first scene
* Curious to be so drawn in to an opera that starts so conflict-free
* Gibbs is really solid, sets himself apart as a character with his voice, not easy to do with two baritones in an opera
* weird ending, again a bit conflict-free for opera
* this piece sits beautifully in the American canon, sharing space with musical theatre but definitely an opera - tells a sort of mundane story, a bit of violence, a low-key villain and a family's practical way of handling things

New Works

* 1: single mom at home with three kids during pandemic, virtual learning, chaotic, noisy, oh man I feel for her
* pretty awesome vocal demands, soprano heights and jazzy chest voice
* when chaos exhausts itself, it gathers together into gorgeous ensemble singing with the whole family, reminding ourselves that we're all trying to hold together and we all miss our lives, and we're a family unit goddammit
* 2. awesome fantastical history, blending Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and the Apollo 11 astronauts, all meeting before the 1969 moon landing
* costumes! 60s fashion show
* muddy text, not always clear what everyone's saying
