* For Magda, this aria starts **(1)** with one of those finnicky tempo markings that Puccini loves, the _rall_ into _a tempo_. It does seem a bit awkward for the singer, but remember that the _rallentando_ is referring to the staccato line happening in the bass. When you do come in, mid-_rall_, it's as though Magda is starting her version of this song with a bit of flair. Hanging out on these first two notes can be a bit of anticipation, a sort of drumroll for what will certainly be the finished, polished product that Prunier started just a few minutes prior.
* If you're really feeling the Italian text here **(2)**, you'll sense an urge to move ahead in this meandering couple of bars. A good pianist or conductor should be able to follow you as you push forward, just enough to suit the natural rhythm of the language, but don't go crazy with an _accelerando_.

* When you start this tune for the second time here **(3)**, it should have some extra excitement. There's some heat in these words, about kisses and revelations and passion. In the line just below, at "Fu la passione!", Puccini gives the soprano and the whole orchestra a grace note; because it's a gesture for the whole ensemble, that little grace note will get more time and emphasis than most. Most sopranos like to tuck the letter "i" in "passione" into that grace note, and then sing a clear "o" for the D-natural. It's something to check with any Italian experts you know, but in my experience, this is the best way of organizing the grace note with this text.

* Ah, this tune **(4)**. This tune is everything. Sopranos know it, too, and it can be easy to overthink this line or try too hard to make it beautiful. So, with the help you'll get from your teacher and coach, I can offer these few tips: get comfy with your vowels first, then add in the consonants. Let the "F" in "Folle" help you get your air moving, but be careful not to waste too much breath on it. Enjoy the _portamentos_ between the A-F on "amore" and the G-E on "ebbrezza", because they're _delicious_. Renew your vowels on the third beat of each bar, to keep these high sustained notes alive _and gorgeous_. And finally, don't worry about your volume; I know a lot of sopranos like to show off a good float here, but don't fall into the comparison trap. Practice this bit at your comfortable volume, and then as a bonus, work with your teacher on refining the volume.

* Puccini gives you a breather here **(5)**, so enjoy how this tune tumbles gently down, and take care with that first semitone from F-E, so it doesn't fall flat. When you really dive down, like the low D on "ridir", remind yourself that you've got to pop back up high, so don't check out of the height you've created.
