* For Magda, this aria starts **(1)** with one of those finnicky tempo markings that Puccini loves, the _rall_ into _a tempo_. It does seem a bit awkward for the singer, but remember that the _rallentando_ is referring to the staccato line happening in the bass. When you do come in, mid-_rall_, it's as though Magda is starting her version of this song with a bit of flair. Hanging out on these first two notes can be a bit of anticipation, a sort of drumroll for what will certainly be the finished, polished product that Prunier started just a few minutes prior.
* If you're really feeling the Italian text here, you'll sense an urge to move ahead in this meandering couple of bars. A good pianist or conductor should be able to follow you as you push forward, just enough to suit the natural rhythm of the language, but don't go crazy with an _accelerando_.
