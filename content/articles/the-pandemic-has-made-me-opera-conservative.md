Readers, are any of you experiencing a strange sort of guilt, on the eve of an opera season that is looking - gasp! - normal?

Here's the source of the guilt: when I see live seasons announced out of the world's major opera companies, I find myself hungrily scouring the production line-up for old standards. Why? What's wrong with me? Should I not be more excited for [_Fire Shut Up in My Bones_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/fire-shut-up-in-my-bones/) than I am for [_Madama Butterfly_ or _The Magic Flute_](https://www.coc.ca/subscriptions-preview)?

It's not that I won't tune in for the non-traditional canon. I'm thrilled by what it means to have Terence Blanchard's opera opening the Met's 2021-22 season. And dammit, I'm _so effing thrilled_ by what it means to have [Othalie Graham, David Pomeroy, and Gregory Dahl](https://www.vancouveropera.ca/whats-on/cavalleria-rusticana-in-concert/) onstage together in Vancouver. I honestly don't know why it feels so fraught to see opera coming back.

My psuedo-psychological theory is this: I'm not so much anxious for the shows themselves (although, I can still feel the stomach-pangs that hit me all last year, each time a cancelled production popped up on my Google calendar); rather, I'm na√Øvely waiting on society to rewind, to go back to "before".

So much of my enjoyment of live performances - and maybe yours too, readers - came from imagining the bustling world, with everyone's busy days and their paths criss-crossing, and the cool magic of seeing some of those people converge in a packed theatre, to sit and experience the same moment together and turn our eyes and ears toward a feat of human creativity.

* and all that makes me feel selfish


* and will I like it the same way? So much of my enjoyment of live shows came from knowing that the world was bustling, busy, that people were flowing in and out of their lives, converging for a moment in this room to see this show with their damn phones turned off (hopefully).
* When that's not in place, and we have to try so damn hard to make art happen, it ironically hacks away at the pleasure I used to derive from it. _What am I doing here? Why have we put up this show? Isn't there something more important I should be doing? Who else gets to enjoy this? Have we vacuumed up precious resources to make this? Is anyone making a living from this? Is this a shiny veneer, masking an industry in peril?_
