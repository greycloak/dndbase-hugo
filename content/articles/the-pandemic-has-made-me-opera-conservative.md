Readers, are any of you experiencing a strange sort of guilt, on the eve of an opera season that is looking - gasp! - normal?

Here's the source of the guilt: when I see live seasons announced out of the world's major opera companies, I find myself hungrily scouring the production line-up for old standards. Why? What's wrong with me? Should I not be more excited for [_Fire Shut Up in My Bones_](https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/fire-shut-up-in-my-bones/) than I am for [_Madama Butterfly_ or _The Magic Flute_](https://www.coc.ca/subscriptions-preview)?

* and will I like it the same way? So much of my enjoyment of live shows came from knowing that the world was bustling, busy, that people were flowing in and out of their lives, converging for a moment in this room to see this show with their damn phones turned off (hopefully).
* When that's not in place, and we have to try so damn hard to make art happen, it ironically hacks away at the pleasure I used to derive from it. _What am I doing here? Why have we put up this show? Isn't there something more important I should be doing? Who else gets to enjoy this? Have we vacuumed up precious resources to make this? Is anyone making a living from this? Is this a shiny veneer, masking an industry in peril?_
