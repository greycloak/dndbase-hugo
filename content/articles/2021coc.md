## _Le nozze di Figaro_

* Cupid-winged ghost-Cherubino production - which is convenient because it's D'Angelo
* much of the same casting as last time (Braun, Wagner)

## _Carmen_

* Ok? Seems soon to revive it, but good excuse to show off young talent in casting
* J'nai Bridges as Carmen is exciting, plus Fabiano and El-Khoury (they're good friends)
* 

## _Katya Kabanova_

* Majeski is great find, her castmates are super interesting (Coloumbe, eg.)
* David Alden, like it or not, but for some reason I trust him with this one
* 

## _La traviata_

* Stephen Lord!
* Radvanovsky/Calleja/Ruci≈Ñski - weird flex for a _Traviata_

## _Orfeo_

* this is the one to get excited about
* Neher/Asselin will be a dynamite pair
* Davies is a big deal

## Extras

* _Fantasma_, Ian Cusson's kid-friendly opera, Dec. 2020
*
