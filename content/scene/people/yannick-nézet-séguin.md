Montreal-born Yannick Nézet-Séguin was appointed as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera, New York in 2018, adding this to his Music Directorship of The Philadelphia Orchestra (where he has served since 2012) and to the Orchestre Métropolitain (Montreal), of which he has been Artistic Director and Principal Conductor since 2000.  He joined Harnoncourt and Haitink to become the third-ever Honorary Member of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in 2016-17.  The end of his ten-year tenure with Rotterdam Philharmonic coincided with the orchestra’s centenary celebrations in its home city and culminated in an acclaimed European summer festivals tour in 2018. 

Yannick has worked with many leading European ensembles and has enjoyed many close collaborations with the Berliner Philharmoniker, Wiener Philharmoniker, Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks and Chamber Orchestra of Europe, as well as with London Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he was Principal Guest Conductor from 2008 to 2014.  He has appeared several times at the BBC Proms and at many European festivals, among them Edinburgh, Lucerne, Salzburg, Berlin and Grafenegg.  North American summer appearances include New York’s Mostly Mozart Festival, Lanaudière, Vail and Saratoga. Once Chorus Master, Assistant Conductor and Music Adviser at Opéra de Montréal he has since conducted at the Wiener Staatsoper, Teatro alla Scala, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Netherlands Opera and the Salzburg Festival. 

In the 2009-10 season, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut with their new production of Carmen, returning every season thereafter (Otello, Don Carlo, Faust, La Traviata and Rusalka). The 2016–17 season saw him take the helm of a revival of Der fliegende Höllander, his first Wagner opera with the company. This was followed by Parsifal in February 2018 and Elektra a month later. In his inaugural season as Music Director, Yannick conducted La traviata (December 2018), Pelléas et Mélisande (January 2019) and Dialogues des Carmélites (May 2019), as well as conducting the Met Orchestra outside the opera house for the first time, in two concerts at Carnegie Hall. The 2019-20 season will see him conduct productions of Turandot, Wozzeck and Werther. 

A major highlight of this season will be his nine-concert series at Carnegie Hall as one of its 2019-20 Perspectives Artists – this will include the Orchestre Métropolitain’s debut appearance at the venue during the orchestra’s first US tour and a Beethoven symphony cycle with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He will also move from the podium to the piano for one of these concerts as he accompanies Joyce DiDonato in their interpretation of Winterreise.

Yannick’s recent engagements include a European tour with the Berliner Philharmoniker; performances of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 13 in Rotterdam, Paris and Dortmund with the Rotterdam Philharmonic and bass Mikhail Petrenko; and appearances in Canada with the Orchestre Métropolitain, pianists Nicholas Angelich and Hélène Grimaud and bass Ildar Abdrazakov. This Summer, he made a series of festival appearances in the US and Canada with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Orchestre Métropolitain and conducted the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks at the BBC Proms and the Salzburg Festival, ending the season at the Lucerne Festival with violinist Leonidas Kavakos.

Highlights of 2018-19 also included a Midwest US tour with violinist Lisa Batiashvili; concerts in Philadelphia and at Carnegie Hall with mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato and with pianists Jan Lisiecki and Beatrice Rana; and The Philadelphia Orchestra’s twelfth tour of China, featuring a series of coaching sessions and masterclasses, among other cultural exchange activities. 

Yannick records exclusively for Deutsche Grammophon. Recent releases include a Collection box with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the first of two albums made with Daniil Trifonov and the Philadelphia Orchestra devoted to the complete Rachmaninov piano concertos. Released in October 2018, it features Concertos Nos.2 and 4 and won the Concerto award at the 2019 BBC Music Magazine Awards. Its companion piece, Destination Rachmaninov – Arrival, featuring Concertos Nos.1 and 3 together with Trifonov’s transcription of Vocalise and The Silver Sleigh Bells, will be released in October 2019. Following acclaimed live performances, Yannick and the Philadelphia Orchestra recorded Bernstein’s Mass (2018). In 2011 began a cycle of Mozart operas for Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, all recorded live by Deutsche Grammophon. Le nozze di Figaro with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe won the 2017 ECHO Klassik for Best Opera Recording and a GRAMMY nomination. The next disc in the cycle, Die Zauberflöte, was released in August 2019. The discography also includes Duets, recorded with Rolando Villazón, Ildar Abdrazakov and the Orchestre Métropolitain; the complete Schumann and Mendelssohn symphonies (Chamber Orchestra of Europe); Tchaikovsky with Lisa Batiashvili and the Rotterdam Philharmonic and Visions of Prokofiev (COE). His discography includes further recordings with Rotterdam Philharmonic (EMI Classics, BIS and DG); London Philharmonic (LPO label); and Orchestre Métropolitain (ATMA Classique).  

Yannick studied piano, conducting, composition, and chamber music at the Conservatoire de musique du Québec in Montreal and choral conducting at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey before going on to study with renowned conductors, most notably the Italian maestro Carlo Maria Giulini.  His honours include Musical America’s Artist of the Year (2016); ECHO KLASSIK’s Conductor of the year (2014); Royal Philharmonic Society Award; Canada’s highly coveted National Arts Centre Award; the Virginia Parker Prize; the Prix Denise-Pelletier, the highest distinction for the arts awarded by the Quebec government, and Prix Oskar Morawetz.  He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Québec in Montreal (2011), Curtis Institute in Philadelphia (2014), Westminster Choir College of Rider University (2015), McGill University in Montreal (2017), Université de Montréal (2017); and University of Pennsylvania (2018). He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2012, Companion to the Order of Arts and Letters of Québec in 2015, Officer of the Order of Québec in 2015 and Officer of the Order of Montreal (2017).
